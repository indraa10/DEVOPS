# chatgpt : 

Given the scenario—**Azure App Service hosting a Docker-based web app**, image stored in **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, backend **Azure SQL Database**, and **Strapi CMS**—the **storage issues** you're facing despite **10 GB free space** and requiring **cache clearing on every deployment** indicate potential issues in container layering, persistent storage, or build cache behavior.

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting & Root Cause Analysis

---

#### ✅ Step 1: **Verify App Service Storage Metrics**

* Go to **Azure Portal > App Service > Quotas (under Usage)**.
* Check:

  * **Total used disk space** (container + site + logs).
  * **Log files size** (`/home/LogFiles` can grow unexpectedly).
  * **Temporary folder size** (`/tmp`, `/home`, `/var/tmp`).

---

#### ✅ Step 2: **Check Docker Container Layer Usage**

* Container images include multiple layers; old/unused layers may persist:

  * If App Service is not doing **full image clean-up**, remnants of previous layers may occupy disk.
  * Layers are stored in the **/home/ directory**, which has a soft quota in App Service Linux.

---

#### ✅ Step 3: **Inspect `persistent` Volumes or `CMS uploads`**

* If **Strapi** is configured to store uploads on local disk (`/public/uploads`), those get written into **/home**, consuming space.
* In Azure App Service Linux, **only `/home` is persistent**, other parts of the filesystem are ephemeral.

---

#### ✅ Step 4: **Inspect Log Growth**

* Logs under `/home/LogFiles` (especially application logs and container logs) can consume storage rapidly.
* Use **Kudu console** or **SSH into container** and run:

  ```bash
  du -sh /home/*
  ```

  To identify large directories.

---

#### ✅ Step 5: **Verify Build/Deploy Process**

* Check if your **deployment is creating multiple image layers**, or **duplicating assets** on every release.
* If using **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** or building on App Service itself, local image cache will grow.

---

### 🛠️ Mitigation Steps

---

#### 🔄 Option 1: **Move CMS Storage to Azure Blob**

* Update Strapi to store media files and CMS uploads in [Azure Blob Storage](w).
* Use `@strapi/provider-upload-azure-storage` plugin for Strapi.
* Frees up `/home` usage drastically.

---

#### 🧹 Option 2: **Clean Up Logs Automatically**

* Add a script in the startup command to prune old logs:

  ```bash
  rm -rf /home/LogFiles/* || true
  ```
* Or configure **App Service Diagnostics > Log Retention** to auto-prune.

---

#### 🐳 Option 3: **Reduce Docker Image Size**

* Optimize Dockerfile:

  * Use [multi-stage builds](w).
  * Base on `node:alpine` instead of full-fat `ubuntu`.
  * Clean `npm cache`, `yarn cache`, and unnecessary build artifacts.

  ```Dockerfile
  RUN npm install --production && npm cache clean --force
  ```

---

#### ⚙️ Option 4: **Rebuild with Clean Image**

* If space is consumed due to layers or cache:

  * Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to **build the image off-platform** and **push to ACR**.
  * Configure App Service to always **pull fresh image on restart**.

---

#### 🧪 Option 5: **Mount External Azure File Share (if needed)**

* If more space is still required and cannot offload CMS or logs:

  * Mount [Azure File Share](w) to `/home/data` or custom path.
  * Use App Service storage mounting capabilities.

---

#### ⚠️ Option 6: **Avoid Local Builds in App Service**

* If you're building Docker image in App Service directly (not recommended), avoid it.

  * Use **external CI/CD** like **Azure Pipelines** or **GitHub Actions** to build/push image.
  * Keeps App Service lightweight.

---

### ✅ Preventive Actions

| Task           | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Setup Alerts   | Monitor `/home` space usage via Azure Monitor.                   |
| Use CI/CD      | Avoid builds on App Service. Build on CI agents and push to ACR. |
| Blob Storage   | Externalize Strapi uploads.                                      |
| Log Rotation   | Automate cleanup or limit log size via Application Insights.     |
| Restart Policy | Ensure App Service is restarted only when image changes.         |

---

Let me know if you want a **Kudu script**, **Azure DevOps YAML pipeline**, or **Blob config for Strapi**.


Great — here's a complete set of actionable items you asked for:

---

## ✅ 1. **Azure Blob Storage Setup for Strapi CMS Uploads**

### 🔧 Install Azure Blob Provider in Strapi

```bash
npm install @strapi/provider-upload-azure-storage
```

### 📝 Configure `config/plugins.js`

Create or update the file:

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  upload: {
    config: {
      provider: '@strapi/azure-storage',
      providerOptions: {
        account: env('AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT'),
        accountKey: env('AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY'),
        serviceBaseURL: env('AZURE_STORAGE_URL'), // optional
        containerName: env('AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME'),
        defaultPath: 'uploads',
        cdnBaseURL: env('AZURE_CDN_URL'), // optional
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### 🔐 Add these to `.env`

```env
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=your_storage_account
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_access_key
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=your-container
AZURE_STORAGE_URL=https://your_storage_account.blob.core.windows.net
AZURE_CDN_URL=https://yourcdn.azureedge.net
```

> ✅ This will **offload image/media uploads** from App Service storage to Blob, solving a major disk space issue.

---

## ✅ 2. **App Service Startup Script to Clean Log & Temp Files (Kudu or Container Entrypoint)**

If using a **custom entrypoint** in Docker:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "rm -rf /home/LogFiles/* /tmp/* && npm run start"]
```

If using **App Service > Configuration > Startup Command**:

```bash
/bin/sh -c "rm -rf /home/LogFiles/* /tmp/*; npm start"
```

> ✅ This will prevent logs/temp files from filling up `/home`.

---

## ✅ 3. **Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline to Build & Push Clean Docker Image**

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  imageName: myapp-strapi

steps:
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build image
  inputs:
    command: build
    Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
    tags: |
      $(Build.BuildId)
    repository: $(imageName)
    containerRegistry: 'your-ACR-service-connection'

- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Push image
  inputs:
    command: push
    repository: $(imageName)
    tags: |
      $(Build.BuildId)
    containerRegistry: 'your-ACR-service-connection'

- task: AzureWebAppContainer@1
  displayName: Deploy to App Service
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'your-RG-connection'
    appName: 'your-app-service-name'
    containers: 'youracr.azurecr.io/$(imageName):$(Build.BuildId)'
```

> ✅ Ensures App Service pulls a **clean image** and avoids building inside App Service.

---

## ✅ 4. **Mount Azure File Share (if Blob not an option)**

### Step-by-step:

1. Create Azure Storage Account → File Share.
2. Go to **App Service > Configuration > Path mappings**.
3. Add new mount:

   * Name: `myfiles`
   * Mount path: `/home/strapi-uploads`
   * Storage type: Azure Files
4. Update Strapi config:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     upload: {
       config: {
         provider: 'local',
         providerOptions: {
           path: '/home/strapi-uploads'
         }
       }
     }
   };
   ```

> ✅ Solves `/home` limitation without externalizing to blob.

---

## ✅ 5. **Monitor & Auto-Clean Storage via Azure CLI (Optional Task)**

Run as scheduled Azure DevOps or Function App task:

```bash
az webapp ssh --resource-group <rg> --name <app-name> --command "rm -rf /home/LogFiles/* /tmp/*"
```

---

Let me know if you’d like:

* A **Strapi-ready Dockerfile** with best practices
* A **Bicep script** to provision the Blob/File storage + App Service
* A **Log cleanup automation script** via cron or Azure Function

Would you like me to bundle this into a full infrastructure deployment template?

# Troubleshooting Azure App Service Storage Issues with Docker-based Deployment

## Problem Analysis
Your team is facing storage issues despite having 10GB of free space, requiring cache clearing for each component deployment. The environment consists of:
- Azure App Service running Docker-based images from Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- MS SQL DB backend
- Strapi CMS

## Root Cause Investigation

The most likely causes for this issue are:

1. **Docker layer accumulation**: Each deployment creates new layers without properly cleaning old ones
2. **Persistent storage misconfiguration**: Temporary files or logs accumulating in mounted storage
3. **Strapi media storage**: If Strapi is storing uploads locally rather than in Azure Blob Storage
4. **Application logs**: Excessive logging filling up space
5. **MS SQL local cache**: If any temporary SQL files are stored locally

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### 1. Verify Current Disk Usage
```bash
# Connect to your App Service container via SSH
# Then run:
df -h
du -sh /home/*
```

### 2. Check Docker Storage Usage
```bash
docker system df
docker ps -a --size
```

### 3. Identify Large Files/Directories
```bash
# Find large directories (run from /home)
du -ah /home | sort -rh | head -20

# Check specifically in Strapi directories
du -sh /home/site/wwwroot
```

## Mitigation Steps

### 1. Implement Docker Cleanup in Deployment Pipeline
Add these steps to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# In your deployment YAML (Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions)
- script: |
    docker system prune -af
    docker image prune -af
  displayName: 'Cleanup Docker artifacts'
```

### 2. Configure Strapi for Azure Blob Storage
Modify Strapi configuration to use Azure Blob Storage instead of local storage:

```javascript
// ./config/plugins.js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  upload: {
    config: {
      provider: 'azure-storage',
      providerOptions: {
        account: env('STORAGE_ACCOUNT'),
        accountKey: env('STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY'),
        serviceBaseURL: env('STORAGE_URL'),
        containerName: env('STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME'),
        defaultPath: 'assets',
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. Configure Log Rotation
In your App Service Configuration:
- Set `WEBSITE_DISABLE_SCM_SEPARATE_LOGGING` to `false`
- Configure Application Logs to use Azure Blob Storage
- Set log level to Warning or higher in production

### 4. Modify App Service Configuration
- Set `WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_OPTION` to `Always` to enable local cache
- Set `WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_SIZEINMB` to limit cache size (e.g., 1024 for 1GB)

### 5. Implement Custom Cleanup Script
Create a startup script (`startup.sh`) that runs before your application:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Cleanup temporary files
rm -rf /home/site/wwwroot/tmp/*
rm -rf /home/LogFiles/*.log

# Cleanup old Docker images/containers
docker system prune -af

# Start your application
exec "$@"
```

### 6. Optimize Docker Image
Ensure your Dockerfile includes proper cleanup:

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy application files
COPY . .

# Cleanup unnecessary files
RUN rm -rf ./src ./tests

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 7. Monitor Storage Usage
Set up Azure Monitor alerts for when storage reaches certain thresholds:
- Create an alert rule for "File System Usage" metric
- Set threshold at 70% of your available storage

## Long-Term Solutions

1. **Implement Azure Storage Mount**:
   - Mount Azure Files to /home for persistent storage
   - Configure Strapi to use this mounted storage

2. **Enable Auto-Healing**:
   - Configure health check endpoints
   - Set up auto-recycle when storage thresholds are reached

3. **Schedule Regular Cleanup**:
   - Create a timer-triggered Azure Function to clean up old containers/images
   - Run daily during off-peak hours

4. **Review Deployment Strategy**:
   - Consider using multi-stage Docker builds
   - Implement blue-green deployments to reduce storage fragmentation

## Verification Steps

After implementing these changes:
1. Monitor storage usage over several deployment cycles
2. Verify that automatic cleanup is occurring by checking:
   ```bash
   docker system df
   df -h /home
   ```
3. Confirm Strapi uploads are going to Azure Blob Storage
4. Check that logs are properly rotating and being offloaded

By implementing these changes, you should resolve the storage issues and reduce the need for manual cache clearing during deployments.

# grok :

The issue you're facing involves an Azure App Service running a Docker-based image stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR), with a backend connected to an Azure-hosted Microsoft SQL Server database and a Strapi CMS. Despite having 10 GB of free space, the team encounters storage-related errors, and clearing the cache is required for each component deployment. Below is a step-by-step analysis to troubleshoot the issue, identify potential causes, and provide mitigation steps.

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Understand the Storage Issue
The error suggests that the Azure App Service is reporting insufficient disk space, even though 10 GB appears to be available. Azure App Service for containers has two types of storage:
- **File System Storage**: Persistent storage rooted in the `/home` directory, used for files that need to persist across container restarts.
- **Host Disk Space**: Used to store Docker image layers and the container's writable layer, managed by the platform. This space is limited (e.g., 15 GB per instance for certain plans) and shared among all containers in the App Service Plan.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/827223/actual-disk-space-requirements-for-azure-appservic)

The "no space left on device" or similar errors typically indicate that the **host disk space** is being exhausted, likely due to the accumulation of Docker image layers, temporary files, or cache data written to the container's writable layer outside the `/home` directory.

#### 2. Verify Storage Usage
To confirm whether the issue is related to host disk space or file system storage:
- **Check Host Disk Space Usage**:
  - In the Azure Portal, navigate to the App Service > **Diagnose and solve problems** > **Linux - Host Disk Space Usage**. This shows the percentage of host disk space used. If it’s close to 100%, this is likely the root cause.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/827223/actual-disk-space-requirements-for-azure-appservic)
  - Run the command `df -h` in the container’s SSH session (accessed via `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`) to check file system usage. Look for the `/` (root) or other non-persistent mounts nearing capacity.
- **Check File System Storage**:
  - Verify the `/home` directory usage, as this is the persistent storage. Use `du -sh /home` in the SSH console to see its size.
- **Azure CLI Command**:
  - Use `az webapp log tail --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>` to stream logs and identify storage-related errors.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-custom-container)
  - Check ACR storage usage with `az acr show-usage --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <registry-name> --output table` to ensure the registry itself isn’t contributing to issues.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-best-practices)

**Observation**: If the host disk space is at or near capacity (e.g., 79% or higher, as seen in similar cases), the issue likely stems from Docker image layers or temporary files.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/827223/actual-disk-space-requirements-for-azure-appservic)

#### 3. Identify Potential Causes
Based on the symptoms (storage issues despite 10 GB free, cache clearing required per deployment), here are likely causes:
- **Large Docker Image Layers**: The Docker image may have excessive layers or include unnecessary files, consuming host disk space when pulled. Each deployment pulls new layers, and unchanged layers are cached, but frequent updates can accumulate disk usage.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/461080/azure-app-service-for-container-says-no-space-left)
- **Strapi Cache Accumulation**: Strapi CMS may be generating cache files (e.g., for media or database queries) in the container’s writable layer (outside `/home`), which isn’t persistent and consumes host disk space. The need to clear cache per deployment suggests cache files are bloating the writable layer.
- **Multiple Containers or Slots**: If the App Service Plan hosts multiple containers or slots (e.g., staging and production), the host disk space is shared, reducing available space per container.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/461080/azure-app-service-for-container-says-no-space-left)[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/827223/actual-disk-space-requirements-for-azure-appservic)
- **Temporary Files**: Application processes (e.g., Strapi, backend, or logging) may write temporary files to non-persistent locations, filling up the host disk space.
- **SQL Database Connection**: While unlikely to directly cause storage issues, misconfigured database connections could lead to excessive logging or error handling that writes to the container’s writable layer.
- **Deployment Artifacts**: Build artifacts or deployment processes (e.g., from CI/CD pipelines) may leave temporary files in the container, especially if not properly cleaned up.

#### 4. Validate Docker Image and Deployment Process
- **Check Image Size**:
  - Run `docker images` locally or use `az acr repository show --name <registry-name> --image <image-name>` to check the size of the Docker image stored in ACR. Large images (e.g., >1 GB) can strain host disk space, especially with multiple containers or slots.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting)
- **Inspect Dockerfile**:
  - Review the Dockerfile for unnecessary files, large base images, or missing `.dockerignore`. For example, including development dependencies or large assets can bloat the image.
  - Ensure the image uses a minimal base image (e.g., `node:alpine` for Strapi instead of `node:latest`).
- **Check Deployment Frequency**:
  - Frequent deployments pull new image layers, which may not be fully cleared from the cache, leading to disk space exhaustion.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/461080/azure-app-service-for-container-says-no-space-left)
- **Verify ACR Configuration**:
  - Ensure the image exists in ACR and the correct tag is used (avoid `latest` to prevent caching issues). Use `az acr repository list --name <registry-name>` to verify.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting)[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/faq)
  - Check if ACR is geo-replicated and if layers are being pulled efficiently. Misconfigured geo-replication can cause partial layer pulls, leading to errors.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance)

#### 5. Investigate Strapi CMS Cache
- **Cache Location**: Strapi may write cache files to a temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp` or a configured cache folder). If these are written outside `/home`, they consume host disk space, which is limited. Check Strapi’s configuration (`./config/server.js` or environment variables) for cache settings.
- **Cache Clearing Requirement**: The need to clear cache per deployment suggests that Strapi’s cache is either:
  - Growing excessively during runtime, filling the writable layer.
  - Not properly invalidated between deployments, causing conflicts or bloat.
- **Log Analysis**: Check Strapi logs (via Azure Portal or SSH) for cache-related errors or disk space warnings.

#### 6. Check SQL Database Connection
- **Connection Stability**: Verify that the SQL database connection is stable. Misconfigured connections (e.g., incorrect credentials, firewall rules, or DNS issues) can cause the application to log errors excessively, potentially filling up the writable layer.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53777219/cant-connect-to-azure-sql-database-from-azure-container-instances)
- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure the Azure SQL Database allows connections from the App Service’s outbound IP addresses. Check this in the Azure Portal under SQL Database > **Set server firewall**.
- **Connection String**: Confirm the connection string in the App Service configuration (under **Configuration** > **Application Settings**) is correct and uses Microsoft Entra authentication or a valid username/password.[](https://www.sqlshack.com/deploying-azure-container-instances-for-sql-server-2019/)
- **Logging**: Excessive database error logging could contribute to disk usage. Check logs for connection timeouts or retries.

#### 7. Analyze Logs for Clues
- **Enable Logging**:
  - Enable container logging with `az webapp log config --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --docker-container-logging filesystem`.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-custom-container)
  - Stream logs using `az webapp log tail --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>` to identify errors like “no space left on device” or cache-related issues.
- **Check Docker Logs**: In the Azure Portal, navigate to App Service > **Container Settings** > **Logs** to view Docker host and container logs. Look for storage or cache errors.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-custom-container)
- **Strapi Logs**: Check Strapi’s application logs for cache or disk-related errors, accessible via SSH or log streaming.

---

### Mitigation Steps

Based on the analysis, here are actionable steps to resolve the storage issue and eliminate the need for cache clearing per deployment:

#### 1. Optimize Docker Image Size
- **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Modify the Dockerfile to use multi-stage builds, including only runtime dependencies in the final image. For example:
  ```dockerfile
  # Build stage
  FROM node:18-alpine AS build
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm install
  COPY . .
  RUN npm run build

  # Runtime stage
  FROM node:18-alpine
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm install --production
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  ```
  This reduces the image size by excluding build tools and intermediate files.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting)
- **Add .dockerignore**: Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`, temporary files):
  ```
  node_modules
  .git
  *.md
  /tmp/*
  ```
  [](https://azureossd.github.io/2025/03/04/%27no-space-left-on-device%27-with-Azure-Container-Apps/index.html)
- **Use Minimal Base Images**: Switch to lighter base images like `node:18-alpine` for Strapi or `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest` for SQL-related components.[](https://www.sqlshack.com/deploying-azure-container-instances-for-sql-server-2019/)[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-faq)
- **Clean Up ACR**: Delete unused images or tags in ACR using `az acr repository delete --name <registry-name> --image <image-name>:<tag>` to free up registry space.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-best-practices)

#### 2. Manage Host Disk Space
- **Restart App Service**: Restart the App Service to clear temporary files and cached layers:
  - In the Azure Portal, go to App Service > **Overview** > **Restart**.
  - Alternatively, use `az webapp restart --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/461080/azure-app-service-for-container-says-no-space-left)
- **Scale Up or Split App Service Plan**: If multiple containers or slots are used, the host disk space is shared. Consider:
  - Upgrading to a higher-tier App Service Plan (e.g., P2V3 offers 250 GB file system storage).[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/827223/actual-disk-space-requirements-for-azure-appservic)
  - Splitting containers across multiple App Service Plans to distribute disk usage.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/461080/azure-app-service-for-container-says-no-space-left)
- **Use Persistent Storage**: Ensure all application data (e.g., Strapi media, logs) is written to `/home` or mounted Azure Files storage to avoid consuming the writable layer. Configure Strapi’s storage settings to use `/home` or Azure Files.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-custom-container)[](https://azureossd.github.io/2025/03/04/%27no-space-left-on-device%27-with-Azure-Container-Apps/index.html)

#### 3. Configure Strapi Cache
- **Redirect Cache to Persistent Storage**: Update Strapi’s configuration to store cache files in `/home` or an Azure Files volume. Modify `server.js` or environment variables:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    cache: {
      type: 'redis', // If using Redis for caching
      dir: '/home/cache' // For file-based caching
    }
  };
  ```
- **Implement Cache Cleanup**: Add a cleanup script to remove temporary cache files at regular intervals or during deployment. For example, in a Linux-based container:
  ```bash
  rm -rf /tmp/*
  ```
  Run this as part of the container’s startup script or CI/CD pipeline.[](https://azureossd.github.io/2025/03/04/%27no-space-left-on-device%27-with-Azure-Container-Apps/index.html)
- **Use Redis for Caching**: If Strapi’s cache is causing significant disk usage, configure Strapi to use Redis (e.g., Azure Cache for Redis) instead of file-based caching to offload cache storage from the container.

#### 4. Optimize Deployment Process
- **Avoid Static Tags**: Use unique tags (e.g., Git commit hash or timestamp) for Docker images instead of `latest` to prevent caching issues. Update the CI/CD pipeline to tag images dynamically.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/faq)
- **Clean Up Before Deployment**: Add a step in the CI/CD pipeline to clear old image layers or temporary files before deploying new images. For example:
  ```bash
  az webapp restart --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
  ```
- **Use Azure Files for Persistent Storage**: Mount an Azure Files share to the container for persistent storage:
  - Create an Azure Files share in the Azure Portal.
  - Configure the App Service to mount the share to `/home` using `az webapp config storage-account add`.[](https://azureossd.github.io/2025/03/04/%27no-space-left-on-device%27-with-Azure-Container-Apps/index.html)
- **Reduce Deployment Frequency**: If possible, bundle changes to reduce the frequency of deployments, minimizing layer pulls.

#### 5. Validate SQL Database Connection
- **Test Connectivity**: Use tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio to test the connection to the Azure SQL Database from outside the container. Ensure the connection string is correct:
  ```plaintext
  Server=tcp:<server-name>.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=<database-name>;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;
  ```
  [](https://www.sqlshack.com/deploying-azure-container-instances-for-sql-server-2019/)
- **Check Firewall Rules**: In the Azure Portal, go to SQL Database > **Set server firewall** and add the App Service’s outbound IP addresses (found under App Service > **Properties**).
- **Use Managed Identity**: For secure authentication, configure a managed identity for the App Service to connect to the SQL Database without storing credentials.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53777219/cant-connect-to-azure-sql-database-from-azure-container-instances)
- **Monitor Logs**: Ensure database errors aren’t causing excessive logging. Redirect logs to Azure Log Analytics or Application Insights to avoid writing to the container’s writable layer.

#### 6. Monitor and Maintain
- **Set Up Alerts**: Configure Azure Monitor alerts for disk space usage to proactively detect when host disk space is nearing capacity.
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Schedule regular cleanups of unused images in ACR and temporary files in the App Service.
- **Check Quotas**: Verify that the App Service Plan and ACR tier meet your needs. Upgrade to a Premium ACR tier for higher bandwidth and storage if necessary.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-best-practices)

### Recommended Action Plan
1. **Immediate Fix**:
   - Restart the App Service to clear temporary files and cached layers.
   - Check host disk space usage in the Azure Portal and confirm it’s the bottleneck.
   - Clear Strapi’s cache manually via SSH (`rm -rf /tmp/*`) and verify if deployments succeed.

2. **Short-Term Fixes**:
   - Optimize the Docker image by using multi-stage builds and `.dockerignore`.
   - Configure Strapi to store cache in `/home` or use Redis.
   - Mount an Azure Files share for persistent storage.

3. **Long-Term Fixes**:
   - Split the App Service Plan if multiple containers or slots are used.
   - Implement a cache cleanup script in the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Use unique image tags and optimize the deployment process.
   - Monitor disk usage with Azure Monitor and set up alerts.

4. **Validate SQL Connection**:
   - Confirm the connection string and firewall rules.
   - Switch to managed identity for secure authentication.

### Additional Notes
- **Strapi-Specific Considerations**: Strapi’s media uploads or plugins may also contribute to disk usage. Check the `/public/uploads` folder and ensure it’s stored in `/home` or an external storage service like Azure Blob Storage.
- **Backup Plan**: If the issue persists after optimization, consider migrating to Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which offer more flexible storage options.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/containers)
- **Community Support**: If further assistance is needed, join the Azure Discord community (https://aka.ms/azurediscord) or create an Azure support ticket.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1gco6f2/disk_space_keeps_running_out_app_service/)

# gemini : 

It sounds like your team is encountering common challenges when running a Docker-based Strapi application on Azure App Service with an Azure SQL Database backend. The "10GB of free space despite 10GB of free space" is a bit contradictory, but I'll interpret it as a general storage bottleneck, potentially related to specific directories or temporary files, even when the overall quota seems okay. The need for cache clearing on each deployment also points to a cache invalidation problem.

Let's break down the potential problems and provide a structured approach to troubleshoot and mitigate them.

## Problem Analysis

**1. Storage Issue ("10GB of free space despite 10GB of free space")**

This typically means one of two things:

  * **App Service File System Limitations:** While your App Service Plan might have a total quota (e.g., 10GB), there are often separate limitations for specific directories, particularly the `D:\local` drive which is used for temporary files, caches, and some application data. This drive can fill up quickly, especially with Docker containers that might aggressively write to disk.
  * **Container Image Size & Layer Caching:** Large Docker images, even if compressed in the registry, need to be extracted on the App Service instance. If you have many deployments, old image layers or temporary files from previous deployments might be accumulating.
  * **Strapi Media/Asset Storage:** If Strapi is configured to store uploaded media files directly on the App Service file system (instead of external storage like Azure Blob Storage), these files can rapidly consume disk space. Strapi deployments often involve rebuilding the admin panel and generating static assets, which can also contribute to temporary file growth.
  * **Azure SQL Database Transaction Logs/Data Growth:** While this is for the database, if the database itself is running out of space or its transaction logs are growing uncontrollably, it can impact the overall application's health and manifest as "storage issues" from the application's perspective (e.g., failed writes, slow performance).

**2. Cache Clearing Requirement on Each Deployment**

This points to:

  * **Stale Content/Client-Side Caching:** Browsers and possibly intermediate proxies (like CDNs if you have one) are likely holding onto old versions of your web page assets (JS, CSS, images) or API responses.
  * **App Service Local Cache:** Azure App Service has a "Local Cache" feature. While designed to improve performance, if not configured correctly, it can lead to stale content being served, requiring a restart or redeployment to clear it. For Docker-based apps, this feature behaves differently or might not be recommended.
  * **Strapi Internal Caching:** Strapi itself has internal caching mechanisms. If these aren't being invalidated properly on deployment, users might see old content.
  * **Build Artifacts/Temporary Files in Docker Image:** If your Docker build process is not optimized, it might include temporary build artifacts or large node\_modules directories that are cached by the App Service or the container runtime, leading to unnecessary disk usage.

## Step-by-Step Analysis and Mitigation Steps

### Phase 1: Diagnose the Storage Issue

1.  **Monitor App Service Disk Usage:**

      * **Azure Portal:** Navigate to your App Service -\> **Diagnose and solve problems** -\> **Availability and Performance** -\> **Web App Down/Web App Slow** or search for "Disk Usage". This tool provides insights into file system usage.
      * **Kudu Console (Advanced Tool):** Access `https://<your-app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net`.
          * Go to **Debug console** -\> **CMD**.
          * Navigate to `D:\home` and `D:\local`. Use `dir /s` to see subfolder sizes and identify large directories. Common culprits include:
              * `D:\home\site\wwwroot\node_modules` (if not properly handled in Docker)
              * `D:\local\Temp`
              * `D:\home\LogFiles` (check log sizes)
              * Docker-related directories if the container runtime leaves artifacts.
          * **Process Explorer:** In Kudu, check the "Process Explorer" to see which processes are consuming resources.

2.  **Analyze Docker Image Size and Layers:**

      * **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** In the Azure portal, navigate to your ACR. Check the size of your Strapi image. Large images (multiple GBs) will take longer to pull and consume more disk space during extraction on the App Service.
      * **Docker Best Practices:**
          * **Multi-stage builds:** Ensure your `Dockerfile` uses multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size by excluding build-time dependencies.
          * **`.dockerignore`:** Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (like `node_modules` if you're installing them inside the container, or local development files) from being copied into the image.
          * **Base Image:** Choose a smaller, optimized base image (e.g., Alpine-based Node.js images for Strapi).

3.  **Verify Strapi Media Storage Configuration:**

      * **Strapi Configuration:** Check your Strapi configuration (`config/plugins.js` or `config/production.js`) to confirm where media uploads are being stored.
      * **Migration to Azure Blob Storage:** If Strapi is currently storing media locally, this is a major cause of disk space issues. **Migrate your media uploads to Azure Blob Storage** using the `strapi-provider-upload-azure-storage` plugin. This offloads media storage from your App Service instances.

4.  **Check Azure SQL Database Storage:**

      * **Azure Portal:** Go to your Azure SQL Database resource. Check its "Overview" blade for "Database size" and "Used data space."
      * **Monitor Metrics:** Look at the "Storage" metrics to track growth.
      * **Identify Large Tables:** If the database is growing rapidly, run SQL queries to identify the largest tables:
        ```sql
        SELECT
            t.name AS TableName,
            s.name AS SchemaName,
            p.rows AS RowCounts,
            SUM(a.total_pages) * 8 / 1024 AS TotalSpaceMB,
            SUM(a.used_pages) * 8 / 1024 AS UsedSpaceMB,
            (SUM(a.total_pages) - SUM(a.used_pages)) * 8 / 1024 AS FreeSpaceMB
        FROM
            sys.tables t
        INNER JOIN
            sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id
        INNER JOIN
            sys.partitions p ON t.object_id = p.object_id
        INNER JOIN
            sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
        GROUP BY
            t.name, s.name, p.rows
        ORDER BY
            TotalSpaceMB DESC;
        ```
      * **Transaction Log Growth:** High transaction log usage can indicate long-running transactions, uncommitted transactions, or insufficient backup frequency. Monitor `log_reuse_wait_desc` in `sys.databases`.
      * **Mitigation:**
          * **Clean up old data:** Archive or delete old, unused data from the database.
          * **Optimize queries and indexes:** Poorly written queries or missing indexes can lead to excessive data growth (e.g., temporary tables in `tempdb`).
          * **Scale up:** If data growth is legitimate, consider scaling up your Azure SQL Database to a higher service tier with more storage capacity.

### Phase 2: Address Cache Clearing Requirement

1.  **Understand App Service Local Cache (for Docker Containers):**

      * The `WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_OPTION` setting is generally not supported for containerized apps. If you've inadvertently set this, it could cause issues.
      * For Docker-based App Services, the container's file system is generally ephemeral, meaning changes made inside the container (e.g., Strapi's local cache) are lost on restarts or scaling events. This is why you need to "clear cache" with each deployment – the new deployment means a new container instance without the old cache.

2.  **Implement Cache-Busting for Static Assets:**

      * **Problem:** Browsers cache static assets (JS, CSS, images). When you deploy a new version, browsers might serve old cached versions.
      * **Solution:** Implement cache-busting by appending a version number or a hash to your static asset URLs (e.g., `app.js?v=1.2.3` or `app.f3f4d.js`). Strapi can be configured to do this, or your front-end build process should handle it.
      * **Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network):** If you're using a CDN, ensure its caching rules are configured correctly to invalidate content on deployment or use cache-busting.

3.  **Configure Strapi Caching (if applicable):**

      * **Strapi Caching Plugins:** Explore Strapi plugins or custom middleware for server-side caching. If you implement server-side caching, ensure you have a mechanism to invalidate it upon new deployments (e.g., a webhook trigger or a custom API endpoint for cache clear).
      * **Consider External Caching:** For higher performance and better cache invalidation control, consider integrating a dedicated caching service like Azure Redis Cache for Strapi's data.

4.  **Optimize Docker Image Build for Strapi:**

      * **Clean Builds:** Ensure your `Dockerfile` performs a clean build, installing Node.js dependencies from scratch each time or leveraging Docker layer caching effectively.
      * **Ephemeral `node_modules`:** Ensure `node_modules` are part of your Docker image and not a persistent volume on App Service, as this can lead to version conflicts and unnecessary disk usage.
      * **Strapi Build Process:** Strapi often builds its admin panel on `npm run build`. Ensure this happens efficiently within your Docker build, and only the necessary output is included in the final image.

### Step-by-Step Mitigation Plan

**Short-Term / Immediate Actions:**

1.  **Emergency Disk Cleanup (if critical):**

      * Access Kudu (https://\<your-app-name\>.scm.azurewebsites.net).
      * Navigate to `D:\home\site\wwwroot`. Look for any unusually large folders or old deployment artifacts.
      * Go to `D:\local\Temp` and delete old temporary files. Be cautious not to delete anything currently in use by the application.
      * **Restart App Service:** A restart often clears `D:\local\Temp` and can sometimes alleviate `D:\home` space issues by resetting certain internal caches.

2.  **Scale Up App Service Plan (Temporary Solution):**

      * If the issue is urgent, temporarily scale up your App Service Plan to a higher tier with more disk space. This buys you time but isn't a long-term solution if the root cause is runaway data.

3.  **Manual Cache Clearing (while troubleshooting):**

      * For the "cache clearing required" on deployment, restarting the App Service is the most straightforward way to ensure a fresh start for your container. This confirms that the issue is indeed related to stale container state or App Service's internal caching.

**Long-Term / Strategic Solutions:**

1.  **Implement Azure Blob Storage for Strapi Media:**

      * Install the `strapi-provider-upload-azure-storage` plugin in your Strapi project.
      * Configure the plugin in your `config/plugins.js` or `config/production.js` with your Azure Storage account details.
      * Migrate existing media files from your App Service file system to Azure Blob Storage. This is crucial for scalability and avoiding disk space issues.

2.  **Optimize Dockerfile for Smaller Images:**

      * **Use multi-stage builds:**
        ```dockerfile
        # Stage 1: Build Strapi application
        FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
        WORKDIR /app
        COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
        RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
        COPY . .
        RUN yarn build # Builds Strapi admin panel and optimizes assets

        # Stage 2: Production image
        FROM node:20-alpine
        WORKDIR /app
        ENV NODE_ENV production
        COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
        COPY --from=builder /app/yarn.lock ./yarn.lock
        COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules # Copy only production dependencies
        COPY --from=builder /app/build ./build # Copy built admin panel
        COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public # Copy public assets
        COPY --from=builder /app/config ./config # Copy config files
        COPY --from=builder /app/src ./src # Copy source files (controllers, services, etc.)

        EXPOSE 1337
        CMD ["yarn", "start"]
        ```
      * **Leverage `.dockerignore`:**
        ```
        node_modules
        .git
        .gitignore
        .env
        tmp
        logs
        .vscode
        ```

3.  **Automate Cache Busting (Client-Side):**

      * Ensure your Strapi front-end or client application uses cache-busting techniques for all static assets. This is typically handled by your build tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Next.js, etc.) by adding hashes to filenames.

4.  **Review App Service Local Cache Settings:**

      * Explicitly check your App Service application settings for `WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_OPTION`. Ensure it's not set or set to `None` or `Disabled` for Docker containers.

5.  **Implement Blue/Green Deployments or Deployment Slots (if not already):**

      * Using Azure App Service deployment slots can help manage deployments more smoothly. You deploy to a staging slot, warm it up, and then swap. This minimizes downtime and allows for easier rollback. While it doesn't directly solve the storage issue, it can improve the "cache clearing required" experience by allowing a fresh container instance to be prepared before going live.

6.  **Monitor Azure SQL Database Regularly:**

      * Set up alerts for high storage utilization on your Azure SQL Database.
      * Review `tempdb` usage. Heavy use of temporary tables or large sorts/hashes can exhaust `tempdb` space, which is tied to your database's resource limits.
      * Consider enabling Automatic Tuning for Azure SQL Database to help with index and query plan issues.

7.  **Application Logging and Monitoring:**

      * **Azure Application Insights:** Integrate Application Insights with your App Service to get detailed performance metrics, dependency tracking, and exception logging. This can help pinpoint if Strapi itself is causing disk writes or memory issues.
      * **Container Logs:** Regularly check your App Service container logs for errors related to disk space or file system operations.

By systematically addressing these areas, you should be able to identify the root cause of your storage issues and deployment-related cache problems, leading to a more stable and efficient Azure App Service environment for your Strapi application.
