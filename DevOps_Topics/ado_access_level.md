---

### **3. Summary of Minimum Roles**
#### **For a Single User to Perform All Tasks**
1. **Organization-Level**:
   - **Project Collection Administrator** (to create projects, install extensions).
   - (Optional) **Service Connection Creator** (if not an admin).

2. **Project-Level**:
   - **Project Administrator** (to manage users, repos, pipelines, artifacts).
   - **Basic** or **VS Enterprise** (for Test Plans).

---

### **4. Least-Privilege Approach (Recommended)**
Instead of granting **Project Collection Admin** everywhere:
- **Customize permissions** for each task:
  - Use **Security Groups** to assign granular permissions (e.g., "Pipeline Creators," "Repo Managers").
  - Example:
    ```powershell
    # Grant "Create Repository" permission to a user
    az devops security permission update `
      --namespace-id "2e9eb7ed-3c0a-47d4-87c1-0ffdd275fd87" `  # Git Repositories namespace
      --subject "user@domain.com" `
      --token "repoV2" `
      --allow-bit 4  # CreateRepository permission
    ```

---

### **5. Visual Studio Marketplace Extensions**
- **Power Platform Build Tools**: Requires **Project Collection Admin** to install.
- **Other Extensions**: Same as above (org-level admin needed).

---

### **6. Critical Notes**
- **Stakeholders** can‚Äôt run pipelines or access code (only boards/work items).
- **Test Plans** require a **paid license** (Basic + Test Plans or VS Enterprise).
- **Service Connections** need **Manage** permissions (granted via **Project Settings ‚Üí Service Connections**).

---

### **7. Permission Cheat Sheet**
| **Task**                 | **Org-Level Role**       | **Project-Level Role**       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Create Project           | Project Collection Admin | N/A                          |
| Install Extensions       | Project Collection Admin | N/A                          |
| Create Repo              | N/A                      | Contributor + Repo Creator   |
| Create Boards Items      | N/A                      | Stakeholder                  |
| Grant User Access        | N/A                      | Project Admin                |
| Create Pipeline          | N/A                      | Contributor + Build Admin    |
| Configure Artifacts      | N/A                      | Contributor + Feed Admin     |
| Configure Test Plans     | N/A                      | Basic + Test Manager         |
| Create Service Connection| N/A                      | Project Admin                |

---

### **8. Recommended Setup**
1. **For Admins**:  
   - **Project Collection Administrator** (org-level) + **Project Administrator** (project-level).  
2. **For DevOps Engineers**:  
   - **Contributor** (project-level) + **Build/Release Admin**.  
3. **For Testers**:  
   - **Basic + Test Manager** (project-level).

Need a script to automate these permissions? Let me know! üöÄ

=======================================================


To successfully perform the tasks you've outlined in Azure DevOps, users require specific access levels and permissions at both the organization and project levels. Azure DevOps uses a hierarchical permission model, where permissions can be inherited or explicitly set.

Here's a breakdown of the access levels and the permissions needed for each task:

## Azure DevOps Access Levels

Azure DevOps has three main access levels that grant or restrict access to web portal features:

* **Stakeholder:** Free, limited access, primarily for tracking work items, viewing dashboards, and providing feedback. Cannot access Repos, Pipelines, or Test Plans.
* **Basic:** Paid access (first 5 users free), provides access to Azure Boards, Repos, Pipelines, and Artifacts. Most developers will need this.
* **Basic + Test Plans:** Paid access, includes all Basic features plus full access to Azure Test Plans for manual and automated testing. Testers and QA leads typically require this.

## Permissions for Specific Tasks

Below are the permissions required for each task, categorized by organization or project level.

### Organization Level Permissions

These permissions are set under **Organization Settings > Permissions**.

1.  **Create Project:**
    * **Permission:** "Create new projects" set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group (Organization Owners are automatically members).

2.  **Grant User Access (Add users to the organization and assign access levels):**
    * **Permission:** "Add new users" set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group.
    * **Note:** To add external users, the organization must be connected to Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID).

3.  **Install Power Platform Tools and Other Required Extensions from Visual Studio Marketplace:**
    * **Permission:** "Edit collection-level information" set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group.
    * **Note:** Users with Contributor access can *request* extensions, but only Project Collection Administrators can *approve* and *install* them.

### Project Level Permissions

These permissions are set under **Project Settings > Permissions**.

1.  **Create Azure Repo (New Git Repository):**
    * **Permission:** "Create repository" set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Project Administrators** group.
    * **Note:** Contributors can typically clone, fetch, explore, and contribute to existing repositories, but not create new ones by default.

2.  **Create Azure Boards Items (Work Items):**
    * **Permission:** "Edit work items in this node" (for the specific Area Path) set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Contributors** group (default for project members).
    * **Note:** Project Administrators can configure Area Paths and Iteration Paths, which control work item visibility and organization.

3.  **Create and Trigger Pipeline:**
    * **To Create a Pipeline:**
        * **Permission:** "Create pipeline" set to **Allow**.
        * **Group:** Member of the **Contributors** group (by default, they can create pipelines). Project Administrators and Build Administrators also have this.
    * **To Trigger (Run) a Pipeline:**
        * **Permission:** "Queue builds" set to **Allow**.
        * **Group:** Member of the **Contributors** group (default).
        * **Note:** For pipelines that access protected resources (like service connections, variable groups, or environments), the pipeline's build service identity (e.g., `[Project Name] Build Service ([Organization Name])`) will also need specific permissions on those resources.

4.  **Configure Azure Artifacts (Create/Manage Feeds):**
    * **To Create a New Feed:**
        * **Permission:** "Create Feed" set to **Allow** (this is typically an organization-level permission under Organization Settings > Artifacts > Settings > Permissions).
        * **Group:** Member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group or explicitly granted this permission.
    * **To Manage an Existing Feed (e.g., add/remove upstream sources, edit settings):**
        * **Role:** **Feed Owner** for that specific feed.
        * **Group:** Project Collection Administrators are typically Feed Owners by default.
    * **To Publish Packages to a Feed:**
        * **Role:** **Feed Publisher (Contributor)** for that specific feed.
        * **Group:** The pipeline's build service identity (e.g., `[Project Name] Build Service ([Organization Name])`) usually needs this role.

5.  **Configure Azure Test Plans (Create Test Plans, Test Suites, Test Cases):**
    * **Access Level:** **Basic + Test Plans** (or Visual Studio Enterprise/Test Professional subscription).
    * **Permissions:**
        * **Project-level:**
            * "Manage test configurations" set to **Allow**.
            * "Manage test environments" set to **Allow**.
            * "Create test runs" set to **Allow**.
        * **Area Path-level:** (for specific test plans/suites)
            * "Manage test plans" set to **Allow**.
            * "Manage test suites" set to **Allow**.
            * "Edit work items in this node" set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Project Administrators** group for full control, or specific permissions granted to the **Contributors** group or custom groups.

6.  **Create Service Connection:**
    * **Permission:** "Create service connections" set to **Allow**.
    * **Group:** Member of the **Endpoint Creators** group (a default security group at the project level) or **Project Administrators**.
    * **Note:** After creation, the service connection itself has security settings where you can grant specific pipelines permission to use it (either "Grant access permission to all pipelines" or individually authorize pipelines).

### General Notes on Permissions:

* **Inheritance:** Permissions are inherited from higher levels (organization > project > object). Explicit "Deny" overrides "Allow".
* **Default Groups:** Azure DevOps comes with several default security groups (e.g., Project Collection Administrators, Project Administrators, Contributors, Readers, Build Administrators, Release Administrators). Understanding these groups and their default permissions is key.
* **Least Privilege:** It's a best practice to grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Custom Groups:** You can create custom security groups to manage permissions more granularly for specific teams or roles.

By carefully configuring these access levels and permissions, you can ensure a secure and efficient CI/CD process for your Dynamics 365 application within Azure DevOps.

=================================================================

Below is a detailed breakdown of the access levels required in Azure DevOps at the **organization level** and **project level** to perform the specified tasks: creating a project, creating an Azure Repo, creating Azure Boards items, granting user access, creating and triggering pipelines, configuring Azure Artifacts, configuring Azure Test Plans, creating service connections, and installing Power Platform tools and other extensions from the Visual Studio Marketplace. The access levels are based on Azure DevOps roles, groups, and permissions as of the latest available information.

---

### Access Levels Overview
Azure DevOps has two primary scopes for permissions:
- **Organization-Level Permissions**: Control access to resources across the entire Azure DevOps organization (e.g., creating projects, managing extensions).
- **Project-Level Permissions**: Control access to specific projects and their resources (e.g., repos, boards, pipelines).

Permissions are assigned through **security groups** (e.g., Project Collection Administrators, Contributors) or custom roles, and users can have **access levels** (Stakeholder, Basic, Basic + Test Plans, Visual Studio Subscriber) that determine feature availability.

---

### Tasks and Required Access Levels

#### 1. Create a Project
- **Scope**: Organization-level
- **Required Permissions**:
  - **Create project**: Users need the "Create project" permission at the organization level.
- **Security Group**:
  - **Project Collection Administrators**: Have full permissions to create and manage projects.
  - **Project Collection Build Administrators**: Limited to build-related tasks; cannot create projects.
  - **Custom Role**: A custom group with explicit "Create project" permission.
- **Access Level**:
  - **Basic** or **Visual Studio Subscriber**: Required to access organization settings and create projects. Stakeholder access is insufficient.
- **Notes**:
  - Only Project Collection Administrators or users with explicit "Create project" permission in the organization‚Äôs security settings can perform this task.
  - Navigate to Organization Settings > Projects > New Project in the Azure DevOps UI.

#### 2. Create Azure Repo
- **Scope**: Project-level
- **Required Permissions**:
  - **Create repository**: Permission to create a new repository in the project.
  - **Contribute**: Permission to push code and manage repository settings.
- **Security Group**:
  - **Project Administrators**: Can create and manage repositories.
  - **Contributors**: Can create repositories if granted explicit permissions.
  - **Custom Role**: A group with "Create repository" and "Contribute" permissions.
- **Access Level**:
  - **Basic** or **Visual Studio Subscriber**: Required to create and manage repositories. Stakeholder access cannot interact with Azure Repos.
- **Notes**:
  - Repositories are created within a project via Project Settings > Repos > Repositories > New Repository.
  - Ensure the user has access to the specific project where the repository will be created.

### Additional Notes
- **Free Tier Limitations**:
  - Azure DevOps provides five free Basic users and one free Microsoft-hosted pipeline (1,800 minutes/month). Additional users or pipelines incur costs (see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/).
  - Visual Studio Subscribers get free access to Azure DevOps without counting against the five free users.

- **Power Platform Tools**:
  - Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools require a Microsoft Dataverse environment, which may incur additional licensing costs for Dynamics 365 or Power Platform (pricing at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/pricing).

- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Use the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions (e.g., avoid giving all users Project Collection Administrator access).
  - Regularly audit permissions in Organization Settings > Permissions and Project Settings > Permissions.

- **Cost Considerations**:
  - For pricing details on Azure DevOps licenses (Basic, Basic + Test Plans), visit https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/.
  - For third-party extension costs (e.g., HCL AppScan), check the Visual Studio Marketplace or vendor websites.
  - If using xAI API services for custom integrations, refer to https://x.ai/api for details.
