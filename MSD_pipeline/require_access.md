	Manage build queue	Permission	Manage build agents and queues	Required for agent pool configurations
	Administer build permissions	Permission	Set security for pipeline folders and jobs	Needed to secure pipeline environments
Service Connections	Manage service connections	Permission	Create/edit/delete service connections (ARM, Docker, etc.)	Required to link Azure, ACR, AKS, D365, etc., for deployments
Extensions	Install Marketplace Extensions	Project Collection Access (via Org-level permission)	Install Power Platform Tool, SonarCloud, Kubernetes, etc.	Required to enable integrations and plugins essential to DevOps tasks
	Project Collection Administrator	Organization-level Role	Install extensions from Visual Studio Marketplace	Must be a Collection Admin to install org-wide extensions
Variable Groups / Libraries	Manage Library	Permission	Add/edit variable groups, secrets, certificates	Needed for secure and dynamic deployment configuration
Environment Permissions	Administer release environment	Permission	Set security for environments (dev, QA, prod)	Required to deploy securely and manage approvals
Agent Pools	Use & Administer Agent Pools	Permission	Use hosted/self-hosted agents	Required to run build/release pipelines
YAML Pipelines	Edit YAML	Permission	Modify infrastructure-as-code pipeline definitions	Core task for modern DevOps workflows

ðŸ”§ Summary: Minimum Roles Needed

Project-Level Role: Project Administrator

Org-Level Role: Project Collection Administrator (for installing extensions)

User Access Level: Basic or Visual Studio Subscriber (Basic + Test Plans) (depending on board usage)

Permissions: Granular permissions listed above must be set under Project Settings â†’ Permissions and Security â†’ Repos / Pipelines / Boards.

ðŸ“Œ Notes:

Installing extensions like Power Platform Tools, SonarCloud, or Kubernetes plugins requires organization-level permission (Project Collection Administrator) â€” this cannot be granted only at the project level.

If DevOps Engineer does not have org-level permission, a separate admin user must install the extension, and then the engineer can use it at the project level.

Service Connections, Variable Groups, and Environments often need manual approval flows, so permissions must be customized per environment/pipeline.
