## 3. Version Control Strategy
The version control strategy uses Git within Azure DevOps, with a branching model designed to support parallel development, testing, and hotfix scenarios. The branching strategy includes Main, Feature, Bugfix, Release, and Hotfix branches.

### 3.1 Branching Model
- **Main Branch**:
  - Represents the stable codebase ready for testing.
  - Used to generate deployable packages for SIT and UAT environments.
  - Code is merged into Main from Feature or Bugfix branches after passing code reviews and unit tests.
- **Feature Branches**:
  - Created for new features or customizations.
  - Branched from Main and named `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/invoice-module`).
  - Used in Dev environments for development and unit testing.
  - Merged back to Main via pull requests (PRs) after code review and testing.
- **Bugfix Branches**:
  - Created to address defects or issues in the Main branch.
  - Branched from Main and named `bugfix/<issue-id>` (e.g., `bugfix/1234`).
  - Merged back to Main via PRs after fixes are validated.
- **Release Branches**:
  - Created for preparing a specific release to UAT and Production.
  - Branched from Main and named `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
  - Used to generate deployable packages for UAT and Production.
  - Merged to Main and tagged with the release version after deployment.
- **Hotfix Branches**:
  - Created to address critical issues in Production.
  - Branched from the Production codebase (ProdRel branch) and named `hotfix/<issue-id>` (e.g., `hotfix/urgent-fix-001`).
  - Merged to Main and ProdRel branches after validation.

### 3.2 Branching Workflow
1. **Development**:
   - Developers create Feature or Bugfix branches from Main.
   - Code changes are committed to these branches and synced to Azure DevOps.
   - Unit tests are executed in the Dev environment.
2. **Integration**:
   - Feature/Bugfix branches are merged into Main via PRs with mandatory code reviews.
   - Automated builds are triggered to generate deployable packages for SIT.
3. **Release Preparation**:
   - A Release branch is created from Main for a specific version.
   - Deployable packages are generated and deployed to UAT for testing.
4. **Production Deployment**:
   - After UAT approval, the Release branch is deployed to Production.
   - The Release branch is merged back to Main and tagged (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
5. **Hotfixes**:
   - Hotfix branches are created from the ProdRel branch.
   - Fixes are tested in a sandbox environment and deployed to Production.
   - Hotfix changes are merged to Main and ProdRel branches.

### 3.3 Version Control Best Practices
- Use Git-based source control in Azure DevOps for F&O and CE projects.
- Enforce pull requests with at least one reviewer for all merges to Main.
- Tag releases in the Main branch to track production versions.
- Maintain a ProdRel branch to mirror the exact code deployed in Production.
- Include both X++ code (for F&O) and Retail SDK (if applicable) in branches.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
Azure DevOps is used to automate the build and deployment processes, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors. The CI/CD pipeline is divided into Build and Release pipelines.

### 4.1 Build Pipeline

- **Repository Structure**:
  - Store X++ code in the `Metadata` folder.
  - Include Retail SDK (if applicable) in the `RetailSdk` folder.
  - Maintain a `RetailSdk-mirror` folder for Microsoft updates.

#### 4.1.2 Build Pipeline Steps
1. **Trigger**:
   - Configure triggers for Main, Feature, and Bugfix branches (e.g., `trigger: branches: include: - main - feature/* - bugfix/*`).
2. **Agent**:
   - Use a Microsoft-hosted Windows agent (`vmImage: 'windows-latest'`).
3. **Tasks**:
   - **Install .NET SDK**: Use the `UseDotNet@2` task to install the required .NET SDK version.
   - **Install NuGet Packages**: Use the `NuGetCommand@2` task to restore NuGet packages using `nuget.config`.
   - **Build Solution**: Use the `MSBuild@1` task to compile the solution (e.g., `**/*.sln`) with `msbuildArchitecture: 'x64'`.
   - **Run Unit Tests**: Execute SysTest framework-based unit tests (F&O) or automated tests generated from Task Recorder.
   - **Generate Deployable Package/Solution**:
     - For F&O: Generate a deployable package using the `Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Tools` tasks.
     - For CE: Export a managed solution using the `Power Platform Export Solution` task.
   - **Publish Artifacts**: Publish the deployable package or solution to Azure Artifacts for use in the release pipeline.

#### 4.1.3 YAML Example for F&O Build Pipeline
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
    - feature/*
    - bugfix/*
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2

### **Comprehensive Deployment Strategy for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Applications**  
**Environments:** `DEV`, `SIT`, `UAT`, `Production`  
**Version Control Branches:** `main`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `release`, `hotfix`  
**CI/CD Platform:** Azure DevOps  

---

### **1. Branching Strategy**  
Align branches with environments and deployment triggers:  

| **Branch**   | **Purpose**                                     | **Target Environment** | **Deployment Trigger**       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `feature/*`  | New feature development                         | `DEV`                  | Automatic on PR merge        |
| `bugfix/*`   | Non-critical bug fixes                          | `DEV`                  | Automatic on PR merge        |
| `release/*`  | Stabilized release candidate                   | `SIT` → `UAT`          | Manual promotion             |
| `hotfix/*`   | Critical production fixes (bypasses SIT/UAT)   | `Production`           | Manual emergency deployment  |
| `main`       | Production-ready code (read-only)              | `Production`           | Manual after UAT sign-off    |

---

### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture**  
**Tools Used:**  
- **Azure Repos** for source control.  
- **Azure Pipelines** for builds/releases.  
- **Power Platform Build Tools** for Dynamics 365 deployments.  
- **Service Connections** for environment authentication.  

#### **Pipeline Stages:**  
1. **Build Pipeline (CI):**  
   - **Trigger:** Commits to `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`.  
   - **Tasks:**  
     - Install **Power Platform CLI**.  
     - Export solutions using `pac solution export` (unpacked for version control).  
     - Run automated tests (e.g., unit tests using FakeXRMFramework).  
     - Publish artifacts (e.g., solution `.zip`, configuration files).  
   - **Output:** Managed/unmanaged solution `.zip` files.  

2. **Release Pipeline (CD):**  
   - **Multi-stage deployment** with manual approvals between stages.  
   - **Stages:**  
     ```mermaid
     graph LR
     A[DEV] -->|Auto-Deploy| B[SIT]
     B -->|Manual Approval| C[UAT]
     C -->|Manual Approval| D[Production]
     ```

---

### **3. Environment-Specific Deployment Workflow**  

#### **a. `DEV` Environment**  
- **Purpose:** Active development/testing.  
- **Branch:** `feature/*`, `bugfix/*` → merged via **Pull Requests (PRs)**.  
- **Deployment Process:**  
  - Automatic deployment on PR merge to `release/*`.  
  - Use **unmanaged solutions** for flexibility.  
  - **Tasks:**  
    ```yaml
    - task: PowerPlatformImportSolution@2
      inputs:
        authenticationType: 'PowerPlatformSPN'
        environment: 'Dev-Env'
        solutionFile: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/MySolution_1.0.0_managed.zip'
        useDeploymentSettingsFile: true
    ```

#### **b. `SIT` Environment**  
- **Purpose:** Integration testing.  
- **Branch:** `release/*`.  
- **Deployment Process:**  
  - Triggered manually after DEV validation.  
  - **Managed solution** deployment.  
  - Run **automated integration tests** (e.g., Azure Test Plans).  
  - **Approval:** Required from QA lead.  

#### **c. `UAT` Environment**  
- **Purpose:** User acceptance testing.  
- **Branch:** `release/*` (same build as SIT).  
- **Deployment Process:**  
  - Manual promotion after SIT sign-off.  
  - **Tasks:**  
    - Import managed solution.  
    - Apply data migrations (e.g., using **Configuration Migration Tool**).  
    - **Approval:** Required from business stakeholders.  

#### **d. `Production` Environment**  
- **Purpose:** Live environment.  
- **Branch:** `main` (via `release/*` or `hotfix/*`).  
- **Deployment Process:**  
  - **Standard Release:**  
    - Merge `release/*` → `main`.  
    - Manual trigger; deploys solution from `main`.  
  - **Hotfix Release:**  
    - Merge `hotfix/*` → `main` → direct deployment.  
  - **Tasks:**  
    - Import **managed solution** with `async` mode.  
    - Enable **maintenance mode** during deployment.  
    - Post-deployment smoke tests.  

---

### **4. Hotfix Deployment Strategy**  
1. Create `hotfix/` branch from `main`.  
2. Fix code → PR to `main` (bypasses `DEV`/`SIT`/`UAT`).  
3. **Emergency Release Pipeline:**  
   - Isolated pipeline for production-only deployment.  
   - Manual approval from release manager.  
   - **Rollback Plan:**  
     - Redeploy previous solution version from Azure Artifacts.  
     - Use Dynamics 365's **solution rollback** feature.  

---

### **5. Key Azure DevOps Pipeline Configuration**  

#### **Build Pipeline (YAML):**  
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - feature/*
      - bugfix/*
      - release/*
      - hotfix/*
  paths:
    include:
      - src/*

steps:
- task: PowerPlatformToolInstaller@2
  inputs:
    DefaultVersion: true

- task: PowerPlatformExportSolution@2
  inputs:
    authenticationType: 'PowerPlatformSPN'
    environment: 'Dev-Env'
    solutionName: 'MySolution'
    solutionOutputFile: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/MySolution.zip'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    artifactName: 'drop'
```

#### **Release Pipeline (Classic):**  
- **DEV Stage:** Auto-triggered → imports unmanaged solution.  
- **SIT/UAT Stages:** Manual approval → managed solution.  
- **Production Stage:**  
  - Pre-deployment condition: `UAT-approved`.  
  - Deployment task:  
    ```yaml
    - task: PowerPlatformImportSolution@2
      inputs:
        authenticationType: 'PowerPlatformSPN'
        environment: 'Prod-Env'
        solutionFile: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/MySolution_managed.zip'
        asyncOperation: true
        maxAsyncWaitTime: 60
    ```

---

### **6. Governance & Best Practices**  
- **Solution Versioning:** `Major.Minor.Patch` (e.g., `1.2.0`).  
- **Deployment Settings:**  
  - Use **Azure Key Vault** for service principal secrets.  
  - **Disable workflows/plugins** during deployment.  
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Azure Monitor alerts for deployment failures.  
  - Post-deployment sync checks using **Microsoft Dataverse Web API**.  
- **Compliance:**  
  - Audit deployments via Azure DevOps logs.  
  - Enforce PR policies (2 reviewers for `main` merges).  

---

### **7. Rollback Procedure**  
1. **Immediate Rollback:**  
   - Redeploy previous solution version from Azure Artifacts.  
   - Use `pac solution import` with `--force-overwrite`.  
2. **Data Recovery:**  
   - Restore production environment from backup (if needed).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This strategy ensures:  
✅ **Traceability:** Branch-per-feature/hotfix.  
✅ **Quality Gates:** Manual approvals at SIT/UAT/Production.  
✅ **Emergency Handling:** Dedicated hotfix pipeline.  
✅ **Compliance:** Auditable deployments with rollback.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Configure Azure DevOps service connections for Dynamics 365.  
2. Implement solution versioning in build pipelines.  
3. Set up Azure Key Vault integration for secrets management.
