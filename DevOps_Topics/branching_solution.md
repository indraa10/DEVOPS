# in azure repo one ms dynamics 365 app repository is having single branch , the repo contain one sub folder which will having javascripts sub folder . now our requirements is to create another branch and work on only javascript files while other team will continue to work on main branch . at some point of time our branch will get merge to the main branch but all the changes made by us and other team should be available post merge in main branch . list out all the possibile branching and merging strategy in detail with example .

To support your scenario where one team works on JavaScript files in a subfolder (`javascripts/`) and another team continues work in the main branch of a **Microsoft Dynamics 365 application** in Azure Repos, you need a clear and conflict-minimized **branching and merging strategy**.

---

## 🔧 Requirements Recap

* One **main branch** (e.g., `main`) already exists.
* JavaScript files reside in a **subfolder** (e.g., `src/javascripts/`).
* A **new branch** (e.g., `js-feature`) will be created to work **only on JavaScript files**.
* Both branches (`main` and `js-feature`) will be **actively developed** in parallel.
* Eventually, changes from `js-feature` must be **merged back into `main`** with **no lost updates**.

## ✅ Goals of the Branching Strategy

| Goal                                | Approach                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isolate JS work                     | Feature branch (`js-feature`) based on `main`              |
| Avoid interference in Dynamics code | JS team works only in `src/javascripts/`                   |
| Preserve both teams' changes        | Use **frequent merging/rebasing** to keep in sync          |
| Smooth final merge                  | Clean commit history and resolve only JS-related conflicts |

## 🧭 Recommended Branching Strategies

### **Option 1: Feature Branch with Periodic Merges (Git Merge Strategy)**

#### 🔁 Flow:

1. **Create branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b js-feature
   ```

2. JS team works only inside:
   `src/javascripts/`

3. Regularly **merge `main` into `js-feature`** to keep up with non-JS changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout js-feature
   git pull
   git merge origin/main
   ```

4. Final **merge back to `main`** via pull request:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge js-feature
   ```

#### ✅ Pros:

* Simple and native Git behavior
* Maintains a **full history** of commits

#### ⚠️ Considerations:

* Merge conflicts can happen if both teams unknowingly touch common files (e.g., shared config files or `package.json`)
* History may be **messy** if not cleaned before PR

---

### **Option 2: Feature Branch with Rebase (Clean History Strategy)**

#### 🔁 Flow:

1. Same as above, but instead of merging `main` into your branch, **rebase** your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout js-feature
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. Final **merge to `main`** is typically done with `--no-ff` to maintain visibility:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff js-feature
   ```

#### ✅ Pros:

* Cleaner linear history
* Easier to track file-specific changes (e.g., JS-only)

#### ⚠️ Considerations:

* Rebasing rewrites history, so ensure team syncs before push
* All team members must understand rebase usage

---

### **Option 3: Git Sparse-Checkout or Subtree Strategy (if JS team must only pull JS code)**

If JS developers **only want the JavaScript folder**, you can do:

```bash
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set src/javascripts/
```

And then:

```bash
git checkout -b js-feature
```

JS team now sees and works only in that folder.

Merge process is similar — merge or rebase `main` as needed.

#### ✅ Pros:

* Keeps JS team focused
* Less risk of accidental changes outside JS

#### ⚠️ Considerations:

* More Git config overhead
* Still must merge eventually

---

## 🔀 Merge Back to `main`: Final Workflow

At merge time:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git merge js-feature   # or rebase-based strategy
```

Use **pull requests** in Azure DevOps to:

* Review code
* Run automated pipelines
* Resolve conflicts, if any

> ✅ Best practice: Rebase or merge `main` into `js-feature` just **before** final PR to catch conflicts early.

## 🧪 Example Timeline

| Date   | `main` Activity               | `js-feature` Activity                  | Merge Action                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Day 1  | Create base branch `main`     | Create `js-feature` from `main`        |                                |
| Day 3  | Dynamics team adds new forms  | JS team adds 2 files in `/javascripts` | JS team merges `main` → theirs |
| Day 7  | Bug fix in common config file | JS team updates helper.js              | Rebase or merge `main` again   |
| Day 10 | Finalize PR to `main`         | Code review + CI                       | `js-feature` → `main` merge    |

---

## 🧰 Azure DevOps Tips

* Use **Branch Policies** on `main`:

  * Require pull request approval
  * Require successful pipeline
* Setup **branch naming conventions**: `feature/js-*`
* Use **path filters in pipelines** to trigger only for JS folders:

  ```yaml
  trigger:
    paths:
      include:
        - src/javascripts/**
  ```

```markdown
# 🔀 Branching Strategy SOP for Dynamics 365 with JavaScript Isolation

## 📘 Overview

This document defines the branching strategy for the Dynamics 365 repository where:
- The `main` branch is the production/stable code.
- JavaScript code is located in the `src/javascripts/` subfolder.
- A dedicated feature branch (`js-feature`) will be used by the JavaScript team.
- Teams will work in parallel without overwriting or interfering with each other's work.

---

## 🏗️ Branch Types

| Branch Name   | Purpose                                     | Who Works Here           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `main`        | Production-ready branch                     | Dynamics 365 team         |
| `js-feature`  | JavaScript development in subfolder         | JavaScript (frontend) team|
| `feature/*`   | Optional short-lived features               | All developers (if needed)|

---

## 📍 Folder Structure

```

/src
/javascripts    ← JavaScript team works here
/plugins
/xrm-configs    ← Dynamics/CRM configs

````

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Process

### 🔹 1. Clone and Setup Repo

```bash
git clone https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>/_git/<repo>
cd <repo>
git checkout main
````

### 🔹 2. Create Feature Branch for JS Work

```bash
git checkout -b js-feature
```

Push it to Azure DevOps:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin js-feature
```

> 📌 Tip: JS team may optionally use sparse checkout to focus only on `/src/javascripts`

---

### 🔄 3. Keep Feature Branch Updated

Pull in new changes from `main` at least twice a week:

#### Option A – Using Merge:

```bash
git checkout js-feature
git pull
git merge origin/main
```

#### Option B – Using Rebase:

```bash
git checkout js-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

> ⚠️ If using rebase, resolve conflicts and run tests before pushing.

---

### ✅ 4. Completing Work and Merging to `main`

Once development is complete:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge js-feature
```

Or submit a **Pull Request** in Azure DevOps:

* Set **`main` as target**
* Review changes
* Resolve conflicts
* Ensure pipelines pass

---

## 📂 Pipeline Triggers (Optional)

To ensure pipelines only trigger for JavaScript changes:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - js-feature
  paths:
    include:
      - src/javascripts/**
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* 🔄 Regularly sync your branch with `main`
* 🚫 Do not modify other subfolders in `js-feature`
* 🧪 Run local/unit tests before PRs
* 📋 Use meaningful commit messages
* 📌 Protect `main` with branch policies:

  * Require PR
  * Require successful build
  * Optional code review

---

## 🧾 Commit Message Format

```bash
[JS] Add modal component to user settings page
```

Prefix commit messages with `[JS]` or `[D365]` to help with audit trails.

---

## 📦 Optional: Use Sparse Checkout

To clone only the JS folder:

```bash
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set src/javascripts/
```

---

## 👥 Responsibility Matrix

| Task                                 | Dynamics Team | JS Team |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| Modify XRM, forms, plugins           | ✅             | 🚫      |
| Modify files in `src/javascripts/`   | 🚫            | ✅       |
| Merge `main` → `js-feature`          | ⚠️  Optional  | ✅       |
| Submit PR from `js-feature` → `main` | 🚫            | ✅       |

---

## 📌 Notes

* Keep communication open between both teams, especially before merging.
* Tag shared files like `package.json` carefully.
* Run pre-merge validation pipelines.

# Azure Repos Branching and Merging Strategy for Dynamics 365 JavaScript Development

## Scenario Overview
- You have a Dynamics 365 app repository in Azure Repos with a single main branch
- The repository contains a subfolder with JavaScript files that your team needs to work on
- Another team will continue working on the main branch
- Eventually, your branch needs to be merged back to main while preserving changes from both teams

## Possible Branching Strategies

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
**Approach**: Create a dedicated branch for JavaScript development that branches off from main.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new branch from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b js-development main
   ```
2. Your team works exclusively in the `js-development` branch
3. Regularly merge changes from main into your branch to stay updated:
   ```bash
   git checkout js-development
   git merge main
   ```
4. When ready, merge your branch back to main through a Pull Request

**Example**:
```
Main branch: A -- B -- C -- F -- G (other team's changes)
                \
JS branch:       D -- E (your JavaScript changes)
```

### 2. Git Flow (Modified for Your Needs)
**Approach**: More structured approach with develop and feature branches.

**Steps**:
1. Create a `develop` branch from main (if not existing)
2. Create a `feature/js-updates` branch from develop
3. Your team works in the feature branch
4. Regularly merge develop into your feature branch
5. When complete, merge feature branch into develop
6. Merge develop into main when ready for release

**Example**:
```
Main:      A -- B -- C ------------------------- M (release merge)
                \                           /
Develop:         D -- E -- F --------------- K -- L
                      \                  /
Feature/js:            G -- H -- I -- J
```

### 3. Forking Workflow
**Approach**: Create a fork of the main repository where your team can work independently.

**Steps**:
1. Fork the main repository to create your team's copy
2. Clone the forked repository locally
3. Create branches within your fork as needed
4. Sync with upstream (main repo) regularly
5. Submit Pull Requests from your fork to the main repo when ready

## Merging Strategies

### 1. Regular Merge Commits
**Approach**: Preserves full history with explicit merge commits.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge js-development --no-ff
```

**Pros**: Clear history of when merges occurred
**Cons**: Can create complex commit history

### 2. Rebasing Before Merge
**Approach**: Keep your branch updated by rebasing it onto main before merging.

```bash
git checkout js-development
git rebase main
# Resolve any conflicts during rebase
git checkout main
git merge js-development
```

**Pros**: Clean, linear history
**Cons**: More complex conflict resolution during rebase

### 3. Squash Merge
**Approach**: Combine all your branch commits into one when merging.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash js-development
git commit -m "Merged all JavaScript updates"
```

**Pros**: Clean main branch history
**Cons**: Loses granular commit history from your branch

## Recommended Approach

For your scenario, I recommend a **Feature Branch Workflow with Regular Merge Commits**:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b js-development
   git push -u origin js-development
   ```

2. **Daily Workflow**:
   - Your team commits to js-development branch
   - Regularly merge main into your branch to stay updated:
     ```bash
     git checkout js-development
     git fetch origin
     git merge origin/main
     # Resolve any conflicts
     git push origin js-development
     ```

3. **Merging Back to Main**:
   - When your JavaScript changes are ready:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git merge --no-ff js-development
     # Resolve any final conflicts
     git push origin main
     ```

## Conflict Resolution Tips

1. **Communicate** with the other team about major changes
2. **Merge often** from main to your branch (at least weekly)
3. **Use .gitattributes** to help with merge strategies for specific files:
   ```
   *.js merge=ours
   ```
4. **Consider partial merges** if only certain files need to be merged

## Example Timeline

```
Week 1:
- Main: A -- B (other team)
- JS:   A -- C -- D (your team)

Week 2:
- Main: A -- B -- E -- F (other team)
- JS:   A -- C -- D -- E' -- F' -- G (after merging main changes)

Week 3 (merge):
- Main: A -- B -- E -- F -- H (merged JS changes G + other team's changes)
```

This approach ensures both teams can work independently while maintaining the ability to combine changes cleanly when needed.

To address your requirement of creating a new branch in an Azure DevOps repository for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 app to work exclusively on JavaScript files while another team continues working on the main branch, and eventually merging changes back to the main branch with all updates preserved, I’ll outline several branching and merging strategies. These strategies will ensure that your team can work on the JavaScript files in isolation, while the other team continues development on the main branch, and that both sets of changes are integrated seamlessly upon merging.

The repository currently has a single branch (assumed to be `main`) with a subfolder structure, including a `javascripts` subfolder. The goal is to create a new branch for your team to modify JavaScript files, allow parallel development, and merge all changes (from both your branch and the main branch) into the `main` branch without losing any work. Below, I’ll describe the most relevant branching and merging strategies, tailored to your scenario, with detailed steps and examples. Each strategy will include how to create the branch, work on JavaScript files, and merge changes back to the `main` branch while preserving all updates.

### Assumptions
- The repository is hosted in Azure Repos, using Git as the version control system (since Azure DevOps supports both Git and TFVC, but Git is more common for modern workflows and aligns with the requirement).
- The folder structure is: `root/<subfolder>/javascripts/`, where JavaScript files are located in the `javascripts` subfolder.
- Your team will work on a new branch, modifying only files in the `javascripts` subfolder, while the other team may modify files in the `javascripts` subfolder or other parts of the repository on the `main` branch.
- The merge should combine changes from both teams, resolving any conflicts, particularly in the `javascripts` subfolder.

### Branching and Merging Strategies

Here are the most suitable branching and merging strategies for your scenario, with detailed explanations, steps, and examples:

#### 1. **Feature Branch Workflow**
This is a simple and widely used strategy where a new branch (often called a feature or topic branch) is created for specific work, such as modifying JavaScript files. Changes are developed in isolation, and a pull request (PR) is used to merge changes back to the `main` branch after review. This strategy ensures that both teams’ changes are preserved through pull requests and conflict resolution.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Your team creates a branch named `feature/js-updates` from the `main` branch to work on JavaScript files.
   - Command: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature/js-updates`
   - In Azure DevOps:
     - Navigate to **Repos > Branches** in the Azure DevOps portal.
     - Click **New Branch**, name it `feature/js-updates`, select `main` as the base branch, and create it.

2. **Work on JavaScript Files**:
   - Your team modifies files in the `<subfolder>/javascripts/` directory (e.g., `script1.js`, `script2.js`).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     # Modify a JavaScript file
     echo "// Updated function" >> <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git commit -m "Updated script1.js with new function"
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```
   - Meanwhile, the other team continues working on the `main` branch, potentially modifying JavaScript files or other files (e.g., `<subfolder>/config.json`).

3. **Keep Feature Branch Updated**:
   - To avoid large merge conflicts, periodically pull changes from `main` into `feature/js-updates` (forward integration).
   - Command:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/js-updates
     git pull origin main
     ```
     - Resolve any conflicts in the `javascripts` subfolder if the other team modified the same files.
     - Example conflict in `script1.js`:
       ```javascript
       <<<<<<< HEAD
       // Your team's new function
       function newFeature() { ... }
       =======
       // Other team's change
       function updatedLogic() { ... }
       >>>>>>> main
       ```
       - Resolve by combining both changes or choosing the appropriate version, then commit:
         ```bash
         git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
         git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in script1.js"
         git push origin feature/js-updates
         ```

4. **Create a Pull Request to Merge**:
   - When your JavaScript changes are complete, create a pull request in Azure DevOps:
     - Go to **Repos > Pull Requests**, click **New Pull Request**.
     - Select `feature/js-updates` as the source branch and `main` as the target branch.
     - Add reviewers (e.g., the other team) to ensure code quality.
   - Azure DevOps will detect conflicts if any exist. Resolve them in the PR interface or locally:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git merge feature/js-updates
     # Resolve conflicts, then
     git commit
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Complete the PR to merge `feature/js-updates` into `main`, ensuring all changes from both teams are included.

5. **Post-Merge**:
   - The `main` branch now contains your JavaScript changes and the other team’s changes.
   - Optionally, delete the `feature/js-updates` branch to keep the repository clean:
     - In Azure DevOps, check “Delete feature/js-updates after merging” in the PR completion settings.

**Example**:
- Repository structure:
  ```
  root/
  └── subfolder/
      ├── javascripts/
      │   ├── script1.js
      │   └── script2.js
      └── config.json
  ```
- Your team modifies `script1.js` in `feature/js-updates`:
  ```javascript
  // script1.js
  function newFeature() {
      console.log("New JavaScript feature");
  }
  ```
- Other team modifies `config.json` in `main`:
  ```json
  {
      "setting": "updated"
  }
  ```
- After merging `feature/js-updates` into `main` via a PR, the `main` branch has:
  - Updated `script1.js` with `newFeature()`.
  - Updated `config.json` with the new setting.
- If both teams modify `script1.js`, conflicts are resolved during the PR process.

**Pros**:
- Simple and flexible, ideal for small teams or focused changes like JavaScript updates.
- Pull requests enforce code reviews, improving quality.
- Easy to integrate changes from `main` into the feature branch.

**Cons**:
- Frequent forward integration may be needed if `main` changes rapidly.
- Conflicts in JavaScript files require manual resolution.

**Best Practices**:
- Keep the `feature/js-updates` branch short-lived to minimize conflicts.
- Use branch policies in Azure DevOps (e.g., require minimum reviewers, enforce successful builds) to ensure quality.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops)
- Commit JavaScript changes frequently with clear messages (e.g., `git commit -m "Updated script1.js for feature X"`).

#### 2. **Git Flow (Simplified)**
Git Flow is a structured branching model with dedicated branches for development (`develop`), features, and releases. For your scenario, a simplified version can be used where `develop` replaces `main` as the integration branch, and your team works on a feature branch for JavaScript changes.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a Develop Branch**:
   - If not already present, create a `develop` branch from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git checkout -b develop
     git push origin develop
     ```
   - The other team continues working on `develop` instead of `main`.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Your team creates `feature/js-updates` from `develop`:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     git pull
     git checkout -b feature/js-updates
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

3. **Work on JavaScript Files**:
   - Modify files in `<subfolder>/javascripts/` and commit:
     ```bash
     echo "// New feature" >> <subfolder>/javascripts/script2.js
     git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script2.js
     git commit -m "Added new feature to script2.js"
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

4. **Forward Integrate**:
   - Periodically merge changes from `develop` into `feature/js-updates`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/js-updates
     git pull origin develop
     # Resolve conflicts if any
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

5. **Merge to Develop**:
   - Create a pull request from `feature/js-updates` to `develop`:
     - In Azure DevOps, go to **Repos > Pull Requests**, create a PR, and resolve any conflicts.
     - Example conflict resolution in `script2.js` as shown in the Feature Branch Workflow.
   - Complete the PR to merge changes into `develop`.

6. **Merge to Main**:
   - When ready to release, create a pull request from `develop` to `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     git pull
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git merge develop
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Alternatively, create a `release` branch from `develop` for final testing, then merge to `main`.

**Example**:
- Your team adds a new function to `script2.js` in `feature/js-updates`.
- Other team updates `script1.js` and `config.json` in `develop`.
- After merging `feature/js-updates` to `develop`, `develop` contains all changes.
- A PR from `develop` to `main` consolidates all updates into `main`.

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of development (`develop`) and production-ready code (`main`).
- Suitable for projects with multiple feature teams.
- Pull requests ensure code quality before integration.

**Cons**:
- More complex than Feature Branch Workflow due to additional `develop` branch.
- Requires coordination to ensure `develop` remains stable.

**Best Practices**:
- Enforce branch policies on `develop` and `main` (e.g., require successful builds, minimum two reviewers).[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops)
- Keep feature branches focused on specific JavaScript changes to simplify merges.
- Regularly forward integrate `develop` into `feature/js-updates`.

#### 3. **Release Flow (Microsoft’s Approach)**
Microsoft’s Release Flow, used in Azure DevOps development, is a trunk-based strategy where most work occurs in the `main` branch, but feature branches are created for specific tasks. Release branches are created for deployments, and changes are cherry-picked or merged as needed. This is suitable if your team prefers minimal branching but needs isolation for JavaScript work.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Create `feature/js-updates` from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git checkout -b feature/js-updates
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

2. **Work on JavaScript Files**:
   - Commit changes to `<subfolder>/javascripts/`:
     ```bash
     echo "// Bug fix" >> <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git commit -m "Fixed bug in script1.js"
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

3. **Forward Integrate**:
   - Pull changes from `main` to `feature/js-updates`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/js-updates
     git pull origin main
     # Resolve conflicts
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

4. **Merge to Main via Pull Request**:
   - Create a PR from `feature/js-updates` to `main` in Azure DevOps.
   - Resolve conflicts, ensuring both teams’ changes (e.g., your `script1.js` updates and their `config.json` updates) are preserved.
   - Complete the PR to merge into `main`.

5. **Create a Release Branch (Optional)**:
   - For deployment, create a release branch from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git checkout -b releases/v1.0
     git push origin releases/v1.0
     ```
   - Cherry-pick specific commits if only certain JavaScript changes are needed:
     ```bash
     git checkout releases/v1.0
     git cherry-pick <commit-hash-from-feature/js-updates>
     git push origin releases/v1.0
     ```

**Example**:
- Your team fixes a bug in `script1.js` in `feature/js-updates`.
- Other team adds a new file `settings.json` in `main`.
- PR merges `feature/js-updates` to `main`, combining both changes.
- A release branch `releases/v1.0` is created for deployment, including all changes.

**Pros**:
- Simplifies branching by focusing on `main` as the primary integration branch.
- Cherry-picking allows precise control over which JavaScript changes are deployed.
- Aligns with Microsoft’s own practices for Dynamics 365.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/how-microsoft-develops-devops)

**Cons**:
- Cherry-picking can be error-prone if not managed carefully.
- Requires diligent conflict resolution if both teams modify JavaScript files.

**Best Practices**:
- Use pull requests with automated tests to validate JavaScript changes.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/how-microsoft-develops-devops)
- Keep commit history clean with descriptive messages.
- Delete feature branches after merging to avoid clutter.

#### 4. **Main-Dev Branching (Dynamics 365 Common Practice)**
This strategy, common in Dynamics 365 projects, uses a `main` branch for stable, tested code and a `dev` branch for ongoing development. Your team can work in a feature branch off `dev` for JavaScript changes, while the other team works directly in `dev`. Changes are merged to `main` for testing and release.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a Dev Branch**:
   - If not already present, create `dev` from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git checkout -b dev
     git push origin dev
     ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Your team creates `feature/js-updates` from `dev`:
     ```bash
     git checkout dev
     git pull
     git checkout -b feature/js-updates
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

3. **Work on JavaScript Files**:
   - Modify and commit JavaScript files:
     ```bash
     echo "// New module" >> <subfolder>/javascripts/script3.js
     git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script3.js
     git commit -m "Added script3.js with new module"
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

4. **Forward Integrate**:
   - Merge changes from `dev` to `feature/js-updates`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/js-updates
     git pull origin dev
     # Resolve conflicts
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

5. **Merge to Dev**:
   - Create a PR from `feature/js-updates` to `dev` in Azure DevOps.
   - Resolve conflicts, especially in `javascripts` subfolder.

6. **Merge to Main**:
   - When ready, create a PR from `dev` to `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout dev
     git pull
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git merge dev
     git push origin main
     ```

**Example**:
- Your team adds `script3.js` in `feature/js-updates`.
- Other team updates `script1.js` in `dev`.
- PR from `feature/js-updates` to `dev` combines changes.
- PR from `dev` to `main` ensures all changes are in `main`.

**Pros**:
- Aligns with Dynamics 365 practices, where `main` is stable and `dev` is for ongoing work.[](https://ariste.info/2020/06/how-do-we-do-branching-in-dynamics-365/)[](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=e11c8506-e1a1-47d5-bbe1-bd3054664444)
- Simplifies testing by keeping `main` production-ready.
- Feature branches isolate JavaScript changes.

**Cons**:
- Managing `dev` as an integration branch adds complexity.
- Potential for conflicts if both teams modify JavaScript files.

**Best Practices**:
- Use branch policies on `dev` and `main` to enforce code reviews and builds.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops)
- Regularly forward integrate `dev` into `feature/js-updates`.
- Test JavaScript changes in a Dynamics 365 environment before merging to `main`.

#### 5. **GitHub Flow (Lightweight)**
GitHub Flow is a lightweight strategy where all changes are made in feature branches off `main`, merged via pull requests, and deployed directly from `main`. It’s similar to the Feature Branch Workflow but emphasizes rapid iteration and deployment.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Create `feature/js-updates` from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git checkout -b feature/js-updates
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

2. **Work on JavaScript Files**:
   - Commit changes to `<subfolder>/javascripts/`:
     ```bash
     echo "// Optimized code" >> <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git commit -m "Optimized script1.js"
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

3. **Forward Integrate**:
   - Pull `main` into `feature/js-updates`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/js-updates
     git pull origin main
     # Resolve conflicts
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

4. **Merge to Main**:
   - Create a PR from `feature/js-updates` to `main` in Azure DevOps.
   - Resolve conflicts and complete the PR.

**Example**:
- Your team optimizes `script1.js` in `feature/js-updates`.
- Other team adds `script4.js` in `main`.
- PR merges both changes into `main`.

**Pros**:
- Extremely simple, ideal for fast-paced projects.
- Pull requests ensure all changes are reviewed.
- Minimal branch overhead.

**Cons**:
- Less structure for release management.
- Conflicts in JavaScript files require careful resolution.

**Best Practices**:
- Use small, frequent commits to simplify reviews.
- Enforce branch policies on `main` (e.g., require successful builds).[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
- Test JavaScript changes in a Dynamics 365 sandbox before merging.

### Recommended Strategy
For your Microsoft Dynamics 365 app repository with JavaScript files, the **Feature Branch Workflow** is the most suitable due to its simplicity, alignment with Azure DevOps features, and ability to handle parallel development with minimal overhead. It allows your team to work on JavaScript files in `feature/js-updates` while the other team works on `main`, with pull requests ensuring all changes are integrated. If your project requires a more structured approach with separate development and production branches, consider the **Main-Dev Branching** strategy, as it’s common in Dynamics 365 projects.[](https://ariste.info/2020/06/how-do-we-do-branching-in-dynamics-365/)

### Additional Considerations for Dynamics 365 and JavaScript
- **JavaScript Build Pipeline**: Since the repository contains JavaScript files, ensure a build pipeline in Azure DevOps validates these files (e.g., using ESLint or Node.js tasks). Example pipeline configuration:
  ```yaml
  trigger:
    branches:
      include:
        - feature/js-updates
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest'
  steps:
    - task: NodeTool@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '16.x'
      displayName: 'Install Node.js'
    - script: |
        npm install
        npm run lint
      workingDirectory: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/<subfolder>/javascripts'
      displayName: 'Run ESLint on JavaScript files'
  ```
  This ensures JavaScript code quality before merging.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/e-commerce-extensibility/set-up-code-sharing-build-pipeline)

- **Conflict Management**: Since both teams may modify JavaScript files, establish clear communication to avoid overlapping changes. Use branch policies to require pull request reviews, ensuring conflicts are caught early.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops)
- **Testing in Dynamics 365**: Test JavaScript changes in a Dynamics 365 sandbox environment to ensure compatibility with the app’s runtime (e.g., client-side scripts in forms or web resources).
- **Cherry-Picking (Optional)**: If only specific JavaScript changes need to be merged, use cherry-picking in the Release Flow strategy.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
- **Branch Policies**: Set policies on `main` to require at least one reviewer and a successful build to prevent broken JavaScript code from being merged.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops)

### Example End-to-End Workflow (Feature Branch Workflow)
1. **Initial Repository**:
   ```
   root/
   └── subfolder/
       ├── javascripts/
       │   ├── script1.js
       │   └── script2.js
       └── config.json
   ```

2. **Create Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/js-updates
   git push origin feature/js-updates
   ```

3. **Your Team’s Changes**:
   - Modify `script1.js`:
     ```javascript
     // script1.js
     function enhancedFeature() {
         console.log("Enhanced JavaScript feature");
     }
     ```
   - Commit:
     ```bash
     git add <subfolder>/javascripts/script1.js
     git commit -m "Added enhancedFeature to script1.js"
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

4. **Other Team’s Changes**:
   - Modify `config.json` in `main`:
     ```json
     {
         "newSetting": "enabled"
     }
     ```
   - Commit:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git add <subfolder>/config.json
     git commit -m "Updated config.json with new setting"
     git push origin main
     ```

5. **Forward Integrate**:
   - Pull `main` into `feature/js-updates`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/js-updates
     git pull origin main
     git push origin feature/js-updates
     ```

6. **Create Pull Request**:
   - In Azure DevOps, create a PR from `feature/js-updates` to `main`.
   - Review changes, resolve any conflicts (unlikely here since changes are in different files).
   - Complete the PR, merging `feature/js-updates` into `main`.

7. **Post-Merge Repository**:
   - The `main` branch now contains:
     ```
     root/
     └── subfolder/
         ├── javascripts/
         │   ├── script1.js  # Includes enhancedFeature
         │   └── script2.js
         └── config.json     # Includes newSetting
     ```

By following the Feature Branch Workflow, you ensure that your JavaScript changes and the other team’s changes are preserved in the `main` branch after merging, with pull requests facilitating code review and conflict resolution.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)

# gemini

You're looking for a branching and merging strategy in Azure Repos (Git) that allows a dedicated team to work on JavaScript files within a subfolder, while another team works on the main branch, ensuring all changes are integrated correctly. This is a common scenario in software development.

Here's a breakdown of possible branching and merging strategies, with examples, that can accommodate your requirements:

## Key Considerations for your Scenario

1.  **Isolated JavaScript Work:** Your primary need is for a team to work *only* on JavaScript files within a specific subfolder without interfering with the main development.
2.  **Concurrent Development:** Both teams (JavaScript and main) need to work simultaneously.
3.  **Merge Conflicts:** The potential for merge conflicts exists, especially if the JavaScript changes interact with other parts of the codebase, even outside the direct subfolder.
4.  **Maintaining Main Branch Integrity:** The `main` branch should always be stable and reflect the most up-to-date, deployable code.
5.  **Integration:** All changes from both teams must eventually be present in the `main` branch.

## Branching Strategies

### 1\. Feature Branching (Most Recommended for this scenario)

This is a widely adopted strategy that involves creating a dedicated branch for each new feature or significant task. It provides good isolation and is well-suited for concurrent development.

**How it works for your scenario:**

  * **Main Branch (`main`):** This is your stable, production-ready branch where the other team continues to work on the Dynamics 365 app.
  * **JavaScript Feature Branch (e.g., `feature/javascript-updates` or `feature/js-refactor`):** The JavaScript team creates a new branch off `main` specifically for their JavaScript work. This branch will house all changes related to the `/subfolder/javascripts` directory.
  * **Other Feature Branches:** The other team working on the main Dynamics 365 app will also create their own feature branches for their respective tasks (e.g., `feature/crm-integration`, `feature/new-entity`).

**Steps:**

1.  **Initial State:** You have a `main` branch with your Dynamics 365 app, including `/subfolder/javascripts`.
    ```
    main
    ├── ProjectRoot/
    │   ├── DynamicsAppFiles/
    │   └── subfolder/
    │       └── javascripts/
    │           ├── script1.js
    │           └── script2.js
    ```
2.  **Create JavaScript Branch:** The JavaScript team creates a new branch from `main`:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main # Ensure you have the latest
    git checkout -b feature/javascript-updates
    git push -u origin feature/javascript-updates
    ```
3.  **JavaScript Team Works:** The JavaScript team makes changes *only* within the `/subfolder/javascripts` directory on their `feature/javascript-updates` branch. They commit their changes frequently to this branch.
    ```bash
    # On feature/javascript-updates branch
    cd ProjectRoot/subfolder/javascripts
    # Make changes to script1.js, add script3.js
    git add .
    git commit -m "JS: Implemented new validation logic and added utility script"
    git push
    ```
4.  **Other Team Works:** The other team continues to work on their respective feature branches, pushing changes to `main` (via pull requests) or their own long-lived branches depending on their internal workflow.
    ```bash
    # On feature/crm-integration branch (by other team)
    # Make changes to DynamicsAppFiles/CRMConnector.cs
    git add .
    git commit -m "CRM: Integrated new sales leads"
    git push
    ```
5.  **Regular Rebase/Merge from `main` (for JavaScript team):** To keep the `feature/javascript-updates` branch up-to-date with changes from `main` (made by the other team), the JavaScript team should regularly pull from `main`. This helps identify potential conflicts early.
      * **Option A: Rebase (Recommended for cleaner history):**
        ```bash
        git checkout feature/javascript-updates
        git pull origin main --rebase
        # Resolve any conflicts (if any)
        git push --force-with-lease origin feature/javascript-updates # Use --force-with-lease after rebase
        ```
      * **Option B: Merge:**
        ```bash
        git checkout feature/javascript-updates
        git merge main
        # Resolve any conflicts (if any)
        git push
        ```
6.  **Merge JavaScript Branch to `main`:** Once the JavaScript work is complete and tested, a Pull Request (PR) is created from `feature/javascript-updates` to `main`.
      * **Review and Approval:** The PR should be reviewed by appropriate team members (including a Dynamics 365 expert and potentially a JavaScript expert).
      * **Resolve Conflicts (if any):** If there are conflicts (e.g., if another team touched files that your JavaScript changes also affect, or vice-versa, which is less likely for entirely separate folders but possible with refactoring), they must be resolved during the PR process.
      * **Completion:** After approval and successful build, the PR is merged into `main`.

**Advantages:**

  * **Strong Isolation:** JavaScript work is isolated, preventing unintended side effects on the main codebase during development.
  * **Parallel Development:** Both teams can work concurrently without blocking each other.
  * **Clear History:** Each feature branch has its own clear history. Rebasing keeps the history linear.
  * **Code Review:** Pull Requests facilitate code review, ensuring quality.

**Disadvantages:**

  * **Merge Overhead:** If the `feature/javascript-updates` branch is very long-lived without frequent updates from `main`, merge conflicts can become significant. Regular rebasing minimizes this.

### 2\. Gitflow Workflow (More Structured for Releases)

Gitflow is a more opinionated branching model designed for projects with defined release cycles. While it can work, it might be overkill if your JavaScript changes are continuous rather than tied to specific major releases.

**How it works for your scenario:**

  * **`main` Branch:** Represents the stable, production-ready code.
  * **`develop` Branch:** An integration branch for ongoing development. All new features are typically branched off `develop`.
  * **Feature Branches (e.g., `feature/javascript-updates`):** Created off `develop` for individual features (like your JavaScript work).
  * **Release Branches:** Created off `develop` when a new release is being prepared.
  * **Hotfix Branches:** For urgent fixes on `main`.

**Steps (Simplified for your scenario focus):**

1.  **Initial Setup:** You'd have `main` and `develop` branches.
2.  **JavaScript Branch from `develop`:** The JavaScript team creates their branch from `develop`.
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout -b feature/javascript-updates
    git push -u origin feature/javascript-updates
    ```
3.  **Work and Merge to `develop`:** The JavaScript team works on `feature/javascript-updates` and, once complete, merges it back into `develop` via a PR.
4.  **Regular Merges from `develop`:** Both the JavaScript team (on their feature branch) and the other team (on their feature branches) would regularly merge/rebase `develop` into their branches.
5.  **Release Process:** When it's time for a release, a `release/vX.Y` branch is created from `develop`. This branch is used for final testing and bug fixes.
6.  **Merge Release to `main` and `develop`:** Once the release is stable, the `release` branch is merged into `main` (and tagged) and also back into `develop` to ensure `develop` includes any hotfixes made on the release branch.

**Advantages:**

  * **Structured Release Management:** Excellent for projects with defined release cycles.
  * **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Development, testing, and production code are clearly delineated.

**Disadvantages:**

  * **Increased Complexity:** More branches and rules can lead to overhead, especially for smaller teams or continuous delivery models.
  * **More Merge Points:** Requires merging back to `develop` and then `main` (for release branches), which can increase merge conflicts if not managed well.

### 3\. Trunk-Based Development (Less common for your specific isolation needs, but good for high velocity)

In its purest form, trunk-based development involves committing directly to `main` (the "trunk") or very short-lived feature branches that are merged back frequently. While it's great for continuous integration and delivery, it might not offer the level of isolation you desire for a specific subfolder team if they need to work for an extended period.

**How it could work (with short-lived feature branches):**

  * **`main` Branch:** All development happens directly on `main` or on very short-lived branches (hours to a day).
  * **Short-Lived JavaScript Branch:** The JavaScript team would create a branch, do their work, and merge it back into `main` *very frequently* (ideally multiple times a day).

**Steps:**

1.  **Create Short-Lived Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout -b js-task-123
    ```
2.  **Work and Commit:** Make small, atomic changes and commit them frequently.
3.  **Merge to `main`:** Immediately create a PR to merge `js-task-123` into `main`.

**Advantages:**

  * **Rapid Integration:** Changes are integrated quickly, reducing merge conflicts.
  * **Continuous Delivery Friendly:** Ideal for teams that want to deploy frequently.

**Disadvantages:**

  * **Less Isolation:** If the JavaScript changes are complex or long-running, this approach could lead to more instability on `main` if not managed with strong automated testing and feature flags.
  * **Pressure for Small Commits:** Requires discipline to keep commits small and frequent.

## Merging Strategies in Git

When you perform a `git merge` or complete a Pull Request in Azure Repos, Git uses a merging strategy.

### 1\. Fast-Forward Merge (Default when possible)

  * **When it happens:** If the branch you're merging from (e.g., `feature/javascript-updates`) has no divergent history from the target branch (e.g., `main`) since the branch was created, Git can simply move the target branch pointer forward to the latest commit of the feature branch. No new merge commit is created.
  * **Pros:** Keeps history linear and clean.
  * **Cons:** No explicit record of the merge event.
  * **Relevance to your case:** If the `main` branch has no new commits since you branched off for JavaScript work, a fast-forward merge would occur by default. However, this is unlikely if another team is actively working on `main`.

### 2\. Three-Way Merge (Default when fast-forward is not possible)

  * **When it happens:** When the target branch has new commits that are not present in the branch being merged, Git finds a common ancestor between the two branches and then combines the changes from both branches, creating a new "merge commit."
  * **Pros:** Preserves the history of both branches and explicitly records the merge event.
  * **Cons:** Can create a "messy" history with many merge commits if not managed well.
  * **Relevance to your case:** This is the most common merge type you'll encounter when merging `feature/javascript-updates` into `main` because the other team will be making changes to `main`.

### 3\. Squash Merge (Common in Azure Repos PRs)

  * **How it works:** All the commits on the feature branch are "squashed" into a single new commit, which is then applied to the target branch (e.g., `main`). The original commits on the feature branch remain, but they are not directly part of the target branch's history.
  * **Pros:** Keeps the target branch's history very clean and linear, as only one commit is added per feature. Good for representing a completed unit of work.
  * **Cons:** Loses the individual commit history of the feature branch on the main timeline. Debugging (e.g., using `git blame`) might be harder as all changes appear in one large commit.
  * **Relevance to your case:** Azure Repos Pull Requests often offer a "Squash merge" option. This can be a good choice for your JavaScript feature branch, as it consolidates all your JavaScript changes into a single, logical commit on `main`.

### 4\. Rebase (Alternative to merging for a cleaner history)

  * **How it works:** Instead of merging, rebase moves or reapplies a series of commits from one branch onto another. It effectively rewrites the commit history of the feature branch, making it appear as if it branched off the *latest* commit of the target branch.
  * **Pros:** Creates a perfectly linear history, avoiding merge commits and making the history easier to read and understand.
  * **Cons:** **Rewrites history\!** Never rebase branches that have already been pushed and shared with others, as it can cause significant problems for collaborators. It should only be done on your local, unshared feature branches.
  * **Relevance to your case:** As mentioned in the Feature Branching strategy, the JavaScript team can *regularly rebase* their `feature/javascript-updates` branch onto `main` to pull in the latest changes. This keeps their branch up-to-date and reduces the chances of large conflicts when they eventually create their PR to `main`. However, the final merge of the `feature/javascript-updates` branch into `main` will likely be a standard three-way merge or a squash merge in Azure Repos.

## Recommendation for your Specific Scenario

Given your requirements, the **Feature Branching** strategy is the most suitable, with a strong emphasis on good practices:

1.  **Main Branch (`main`):** This remains the stable, deployable branch.
2.  **JavaScript Feature Branch (e.g., `feature/js-refactor` or `feature/js-feature-new-module`):**
      * The JavaScript team creates a dedicated feature branch for their work.
      * They work exclusively within the `/subfolder/javascripts` directory on this branch.
      * **Crucial:** The JavaScript team should frequently rebase their `feature/js-refactor` branch onto `main` (e.g., daily or multiple times a day) to integrate changes from the other team. This prevents "big bang" merges later on and helps identify conflicts early.
      * They commit frequently and push their changes to their feature branch.
3.  **Other Team's Feature Branches:** The other team continues their work on their own feature branches, merging into `main` via PRs.
4.  **Pull Request (PR) from JavaScript to `main`:**
      * Once the JavaScript work is complete and thoroughly tested, the JavaScript team creates a PR from `feature/js-refactor` to `main`.
      * **Merge Type in Azure Repos:**
          * **Squash Merge:** This is often the best choice for integrating a feature branch into `main`. It consolidates all the JavaScript team's commits into a single commit on `main`, keeping `main`'s history clean. This is particularly useful if the JavaScript team had many small, iterative commits on their feature branch.
          * **Merge Commit (Three-Way Merge):** This will preserve all the individual commits from the JavaScript branch, showing the full history. This is also a valid option if you prefer to see the detailed commit history of the feature branch directly on `main`.

**Example Workflow with Rebase and Squash Merge:**

```

In this diagram:

  * `C0`, `C1`, `C2`, `C3` represent commits on the `main` branch made by the "other team."
  * `J1`, `J2` represent commits made by the JavaScript team on their `feature/js-refactor` branch.
  * The `merge main` step on `feature/js-refactor` signifies the rebase operation, bringing `J1` and `J2` on top of `C3` as `J1'` and `J2'`.
  * The final `merge feature/js-refactor type: squash` into `main` results in a single commit `M1` on `main` that encapsulates all the JavaScript changes.

By following this, you achieve the following:

  * **Isolation for JavaScript work.**
  * **Concurrent development.**
  * **Clean `main` branch history** (especially with squash merge).
  * **All changes available post-merge.**

Remember to communicate clearly with both teams about the chosen branching strategy and the expectations for frequent integration. Azure DevOps Pull Request features will be invaluable for managing reviews and merges.
