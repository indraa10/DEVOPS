how to create self signed ssl certificate in ec2 instance for python backend app to access https://ec2-public-ip:8001/docs link

# Creating a Self-Signed SSL Certificate for Python Backend on EC2

To secure your Python backend application with HTTPS on your EC2 instance, follow these steps to create and configure a self-signed SSL certificate:

## Step 1: Connect to your EC2 instance
SSH into your EC2 instance:
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
```

## Step 2: Install OpenSSL (if not already installed)
```bash
sudo yum install openssl -y  # For Amazon Linux
# Or for Ubuntu:
# sudo apt-get install openssl -y
```

## Step 3: Create a self-signed certificate
```bash
mkdir ~/ssl
cd ~/ssl

# Generate private key and certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=ec2-public-ip"
```

Replace "ec2-public-ip" with your actual EC2 public IP address or domain name.

## Step 4: Set appropriate permissions
```bash
chmod 400 key.pem
chmod 444 cert.pem
```

## Step 5: Configure your Python application

### If using FastAPI:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(
        app,
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=8001,
        ssl_keyfile="/home/ec2-user/ssl/key.pem",
        ssl_certfile="/home/ec2-user/ssl/cert.pem"
    )
```

### If using Flask with Waitress:
```python
from flask import Flask
from waitress import serve
import ssl

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
    context.load_cert_chain('/home/ec2-user/ssl/cert.pem', '/home/ec2-user/ssl/key.pem')
    serve(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001, ssl_context=context)
```

## Step 6: Open the port in EC2 security group
Ensure your EC2 security group allows inbound traffic on port 8001 (or your chosen port).

## Step 7: Start your application
```bash
python your_app.py
```

## Step 8: Access your application
Visit `https://<ec2-public-ip>:8001/docs` in your browser. You'll see a security warning because the certificate is self-signed - this is expected. You can proceed by accepting the risk.

## Important Notes:
1. Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers by default and are only suitable for development/testing.
2. For production, consider using Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager.
3. The certificate is valid for 365 days (as specified by `-days 365`). You'll need to recreate it after expiration.
4. Make sure to use the exact IP or domain in the CN (Common Name) that you'll use to access the service.
