# -----------------------------------------------------

Setting up Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 application using Azure DevOps involves integrating security tools into your CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in the code and runtime environment. Below is a detailed guide on how to configure SAST and DAST, the associated costs, and the required integrations, configurations, and access permissions. Since Dynamics 365 is a highly customizable platform with a mix of low-code, pro-code, and cloud-based components, the setup must account for its unique architecture.

---

### **1. Setting Up SAST and DAST for Dynamics 365 in Azure DevOps**

#### **SAST Setup**
SAST analyzes source code or binaries without executing the application, making it suitable for custom code developed for Dynamics 365 (e.g., plugins, custom workflows, or JavaScript in Power Apps).

1. **Choose a SAST Tool**:
   - **Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO)**: A native Azure DevOps extension that integrates tools like CodeQL, BinSkim, and Credential Scanner. It‚Äôs ideal for Dynamics 365 customizations in C#, JavaScript, or TypeScript.
   - **Third-Party Tools**: Options like SonarQube, Checkmarx SAST, or Fortify can be integrated via Azure DevOps Marketplace extensions.
   - Ensure the tool supports languages used in Dynamics 365 customizations (e.g., C# for plugins, JavaScript for client-side scripts).

2. **Integration Steps**:
   - **Install the Microsoft Security DevOps Extension**:
     - Navigate to the Azure DevOps Marketplace.
     - Install the *Microsoft Security DevOps* extension. You need Project Collection Administrator privileges to install it.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/azure-devops-extension)
     - Configure the extension to include tools like CodeQL for code analysis and Credential Scanner for detecting secrets in code.
   - **Configure the Pipeline**:
     - Create or edit an Azure DevOps pipeline (YAML or classic).
     - Add the *MicrosoftSecurityDevOps@1* task to your pipeline YAML:
       ```yaml
       - task: MicrosoftSecurityDevOps@1
         displayName: 'Run Microsoft Security DevOps'
         inputs:
           categories: 'CodeAnalysis'
       ```
     - Ensure the pipeline publishes results in SARIF format to the *CodeAnalysisLogs* artifact for integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/azure-devops-extension)
   - **Customize Rules**:
     - Tailor SAST rules to focus on Dynamics 365-specific vulnerabilities, such as insecure API calls or improper data handling in plugins.
     - For CodeQL, customize queries to detect issues like SQL injection or insecure deserialization in C# code.
   - **Gating Controls**:
     - Configure build validation to fail the pipeline if critical vulnerabilities are detected, preventing insecure code from being committed.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-devops-security)

3. **Specifics for Dynamics 365**:
   - **Custom Code**: SAST is most relevant for custom plugins, workflows, or scripts developed in C#, JavaScript, or TypeScript for Dynamics 365.
   - **Low-Code Components**: SAST tools may not directly analyze low-code configurations (e.g., Power Apps or Power Automate flows). Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for third-party dependencies.
   - **Repository Setup**: Ensure custom code is stored in Azure Repos or GitHub for scanning.

#### **DAST Setup**
DAST tests the running application to identify vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or authentication issues, suitable for Dynamics 365 web interfaces or APIs.

1. **Choose a DAST Tool**:
   - **Third-Party Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or HCL AppScan are popular choices available via Azure DevOps Marketplace.[](https://medium.com/%40venkataramarao.n/devsecops-with-azure-devops-1b775033c75a)
   - **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Can integrate DAST results but typically requires third-party tools for actual scanning.
   - **Open-Source Options**: OWASP ZAP or Arachni for cost-effective solutions.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/secure-develop)

2. **Integration Steps**:
   - **Install the DAST Tool**:
     - Install the chosen DAST tool‚Äôs extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace (e.g., HCL AppScan).[](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HCLTechnologies.ApplicationSecurity-VSTS)
     - Alternatively, use a custom script to invoke OWASP ZAP in the pipeline.
   - **Configure the Pipeline**:
     - Add a task to deploy the Dynamics 365 application to a test/staging environment (e.g., a sandbox instance).
     - Include a DAST task to scan the running application. For example, with OWASP ZAP:
       ```yaml
       - task: CmdLine@2
         displayName: 'Run OWASP ZAP Scan'
         inputs:
           script: |
             zap.sh -cmd -quickurl https://your-dynamics-365-url -quickout $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/zap-report.html
       ```
     - Publish scan results as a pipeline artifact for review.
   - **Test Coverage**:
     - Configure the DAST tool to target Dynamics 365 endpoints, such as web forms, APIs, or Power Apps portals.
     - Simulate real-world attack scenarios, focusing on injection flaws, XSS, or broken authentication.[](https://k21academy.com/devops-job-bootcamp/sast-and-dast-in-devops/)
   - **Gating Controls**:
     - Set up pipeline gates to block deployment if critical vulnerabilities are found.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-devops-security)

3. **Specifics for Dynamics 365**:
   - **Test Environment**: Deploy Dynamics 365 customizations to a sandbox environment for DAST scanning, as production scanning may risk data exposure.
   - **APIs and Portals**: Focus DAST on public-facing components like Dynamics 365 portals or custom APIs.
   - **Authentication**: Configure DAST tools to handle Dynamics 365‚Äôs Microsoft Entra ID authentication using service principals or OAuth tokens.

#### **General Integration Best Practices**:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Use Azure DevOps Pipelines to automate SAST and DAST scans on every commit or pull request.
  - Combine SAST (early in the pipeline) with DAST (after deployment to a test environment) for comprehensive coverage.[](https://k21academy.com/devops-job-bootcamp/sast-and-dast-in-devops/)
- **Defender for Cloud Integration**:
  - Onboard Azure DevOps repositories to Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor SAST and DAST results in SARIF format.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/azure-devops-extension)
  - Use the *PublishBuildArtifacts@1* task to upload results:
    ```yaml
    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      inputs:
        pathToPublish: 'results.sarif'
        artifactName: 'CodeAnalysisLogs'
    ```
- **Threat Modeling**:
  - Perform threat modeling for Dynamics 365 customizations to identify critical components (e.g., plugins, APIs) for targeted scanning.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-devops-security)
- **Data Protection**:
  - Use masked datasets in test environments to avoid exposing production data.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/secure-develop)
  - Integrate Azure Key Vault to securely manage credentials used in pipelines.[](https://medium.com/%40venkataramarao.n/devsecops-with-azure-devops-1b775033c75a)

Setting up Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for Dynamics 365 applications using Azure DevOps is a crucial step in implementing a robust DevSecOps pipeline. This ensures that security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed early in the development lifecycle.

Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, including associated costs, integrations, configurations, and required access:

## Understanding SAST and DAST for Dynamics 365

* **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Analyzes the source code, bytecode, or binaries of your Dynamics 365 application *without executing it*. It's like reviewing the blueprints for flaws. For Dynamics 365, this primarily applies to custom code (plugins, workflows, client-side scripts, custom web resources) written in C#, JavaScript, etc., as well as any custom integrations.
* **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** Analyzes the running application from the outside, simulating real-world attacks. It's like trying to break into a fully built house. For Dynamics 365, this would involve scanning the deployed application, interacting with its web interface, APIs, and custom portals.

## Setting up SAST in Azure DevOps for Dynamics 365

### 1. Choosing a SAST Tool

Several SAST tools integrate with Azure DevOps. Some popular choices include:

* **Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) extension:** This is a command-line application that integrates static analysis tools, including those from Microsoft, into your CI/CD pipeline. It supports various languages and can be integrated via YAML pipelines. This is a good starting point for Azure users.
* **SonarQube:** A widely used open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It offers a broad range of static analysis capabilities and has excellent Azure DevOps integration.
* **Checkmarx:** A commercial SAST solution known for its comprehensive language support and integration capabilities.
* **Veracode:** Another popular commercial SAST and DAST solution with strong Azure DevOps integration.
* **GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps:** Offers code scanning (using CodeQL) for security vulnerabilities directly within Azure Repos. This is a strong option if your code is in Azure Repos.

### 2. Integration and Configuration

The general steps for integrating a SAST tool into your Azure DevOps pipeline:

* **Install the Azure DevOps Extension:** Most SAST tools provide an extension for Azure DevOps. Install it from the Azure DevOps Marketplace to add specific tasks to your pipelines.
* **Add SAST Task to Build Pipeline (CI):**
    * **YAML Pipeline:** Add a task to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to run the SAST scan. This typically happens after the code compilation step.
    * **Classic Pipeline:** Add a new task to your build definition.
* **Configure Scan Parameters:** This includes specifying the source code directories to scan, the programming languages used, desired rule sets (e.g., OWASP Top 10), and reporting formats (often SARIF for easy integration with Defender for Cloud).
* **Define Scan Triggers:** Configure the SAST scan to run automatically on:
    * **Every Pull Request (PR):** This "shifts left" security, providing immediate feedback to developers on new vulnerabilities before they are merged.
    * **Every Build:** A more comprehensive scan on the main branch after successful builds.
* **Review and Act on Findings:**
    * **Azure DevOps Scan Tab:** Many SAST extensions will display results directly within Azure DevOps under a "Scans" or "Security" tab.
    * **Tool's Dashboard:** For more detailed analysis, you'll likely access the SAST tool's dedicated dashboard (e.g., SonarQube UI, Checkmarx portal).
    * **Integrate with Work Item Tracking:** Configure the tool to automatically create work items (bugs, security tasks) in Azure Boards for critical vulnerabilities.

## Setting up DAST in Azure DevOps for Dynamics 365

### 1. Choosing a DAST Tool

DAST tools are designed to interact with a running application. Options include:

* **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** A popular open-source DAST tool that can be integrated into your pipeline.
* **Commercial DAST Solutions:** Many vendors offer DAST capabilities, often bundled with SAST (e.g., Veracode, Checkmarx DAST, Invicti, Acunetix).
* **Custom Scripting with tools like Selenium/Playwright:** For highly customized Dynamics 365 portals or flows, you might combine a DAST scanner with automated UI testing frameworks to ensure the scanner can properly navigate and interact with the application.

### 2. Integration and Configuration

Integrating DAST into your Azure DevOps pipeline requires a deployed instance of your Dynamics 365 application.

* **Deployment Target:** DAST needs a deployed application. This typically means deploying your Dynamics 365 solution and any custom web applications to a test or staging environment as part of your Release Pipeline (CD).
* **Add DAST Task to Release Pipeline (CD):**
    * **YAML Pipeline:** Add a task to your release pipeline (after deployment).
    * **Classic Pipeline:** Add a new task to your release definition.
* **Configure Scan Parameters:**
    * **Target URL:** The URL of your deployed Dynamics 365 application or custom portal.
    * **Authentication:** How the DAST tool will authenticate with your application (e.g., provide credentials, session cookies, API keys). This is crucial for scanning authenticated areas.
    * **Scan Policy/Scope:** Define what parts of the application to scan and which rules to apply.
    * **Reporting:** Configure output formats for scan results.
* **Define Scan Triggers:** Run DAST scans after successful deployments to test/staging environments.
* **Review and Act on Findings:** Similar to SAST, review results in Azure DevOps or the DAST tool's dashboard and create work items for remediation.

## Associated Costs

The costs associated with SAST and DAST in Azure DevOps for Dynamics 365 can vary significantly based on the tools you choose and the scale of your operations.

### Azure DevOps Costs:

* **Azure Pipelines:**
    * **Microsoft-hosted agents:** 1 free parallel job with 1,800 minutes per month. Additional parallel jobs cost $40 per month.
    * **Self-hosted agents:** 1 free parallel job with unlimited minutes. Additional self-hosted parallel jobs cost $15 per month.
    * Running SAST/DAST scans consumes pipeline minutes, so consider if you'll need additional parallel jobs.
* **Azure Artifacts:** 2 GiB free, then starting at $2 per GiB. (Less relevant for SAST/DAST directly, but important for general DevOps).
* **Azure DevOps User Licenses:** First 5 users free, then $6 per user per month for Basic plan.
* **GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps:** $30 per committer per month for code security (includes code scanning and dependency scanning). Secret protection is $19 per committer per month. This is a significant cost if you have many committers.

### SAST/DAST Tool Costs:

* **Open Source (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP):**
    * **Free:** The tools themselves are free.
    * **Infrastructure Costs:** You'll need to host these tools (e.g., on Azure VMs, Azure Kubernetes Service) which incurs Azure compute, storage, and networking costs.
    * **Maintenance/Support:** You're responsible for maintaining and updating the tools, or you might pay for commercial support.
* **Commercial Tools (e.g., Checkmarx, Veracode, Fortify):**
    * **Licensing Fees:** These are typically subscription-based, often priced per developer, per application, or per scan. These costs can be substantial, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars annually, or even more for large enterprises.
    * **On-Premise vs. SaaS:** Some tools offer both on-premise deployment (requiring your infrastructure) and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) models, where the vendor hosts the tool. SaaS can reduce your infrastructure overhead.
    * **Professional Services:** You might incur costs for initial setup, integration, and training from the vendor.

### Dynamics 365 Specific Considerations:

* **Dedicated Test Environments:** Running DAST often requires a dedicated test or staging environment for your Dynamics 365 application. This incurs Dynamics 365 licensing costs for non-production instances and associated Azure resources (if hosted on Azure).
* **Data Generation:** For effective DAST, you might need realistic test data, which could involve processes and tools to generate or anonymize data.

## Integration and Configuration Details

### Azure DevOps Integration:

* **Service Connections:** You'll likely need to create Azure DevOps Service Connections to:
    * Connect to your Azure subscription for deploying Dynamics 365 components or related Azure services.
    * Connect to external SAST/DAST tools (if not using marketplace extensions that handle this automatically).
* **Pipeline Tasks:** Leverage predefined tasks from marketplace extensions or custom PowerShell/Bash scripts to:
    * Install SAST/DAST agents or CLIs on your build/release agents.
    * Execute scan commands.
    * Publish scan results (e.g., SARIF files) as pipeline artifacts.
* **Build Agents:** Ensure your Azure DevOps build agents (Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted) have the necessary software and dependencies for your chosen SAST/DAST tools (e.g., .NET SDK, Java, Node.js, specific tool executables).
* **Variables and Secret Management:**
    * Use Azure DevOps Variable Groups to store common configuration values.
    * Store sensitive information (API keys, credentials for DAST authentication) securely using Azure Key Vault linked to your Azure DevOps variable groups.
* **Branch Policies:** Enforce SAST scans on pull requests by setting up branch policies that require successful SAST scan results before merging.

### Dynamics 365 Specific Configuration:

* **Solution Management:** Ensure your Dynamics 365 solutions are properly managed in source control (Azure Repos). This is fundamental for SAST.
* **Automated Deployment:** Set up your Azure DevOps Release Pipelines to automate the deployment of your Dynamics 365 solutions to test environments. This is a prerequisite for DAST.
* **Web Application/API Endpoints:** Identify all relevant web applications, custom portals, and APIs associated with your Dynamics 365 solution that need to be scanned by DAST.
* **Authentication for DAST:** Configure the DAST tool to authenticate with your Dynamics 365 instance or custom applications. This might involve:
    * **Service Accounts:** Creating dedicated service accounts in Dynamics 365 (with minimal necessary permissions) for the DAST scanner.
    * **OAuth/Azure AD:** If your custom applications use Azure AD for authentication, configure the DAST tool to perform an OAuth flow or obtain tokens.
    * **Session Recording:** Some DAST tools allow you to record a user session and then replay it during the scan.

## Related Access Requirements

To set up SAST and DAST for Dynamics 365 in Azure DevOps, you'll need various levels of access:

### Azure DevOps Access:

* **Project Collection Administrator:** Required to install extensions from the Marketplace and manage organization-level settings.
* **Project Administrator:** To create and manage pipelines, service connections, variable groups, and security settings within a project.
* **Build Administrator/Contributor:** To define and execute build and release pipelines.
* **Repository Contributor:** To push code, create pull requests, and view SAST results related to code.

### Azure Access:

* **Contributor/Owner Role on Azure Subscription/Resource Group:** If you're hosting self-hosted agents, Azure Key Vault, or your DAST target environments on Azure.
* **Managed Identity or Service Principal:** For Azure DevOps to securely access Azure resources (e.g., Key Vault for secrets).

### Dynamics 365 Access:

* **System Customizer/System Administrator Security Role:** In Dynamics 365 for deploying solutions during release pipelines.
* **Dedicated Service Account (for DAST):** A Dynamics 365 user account with appropriate (least privilege) security roles to allow the DAST scanner to interact with the application. Avoid using highly privileged accounts for DAST.

### External Tool Access:

* **SAST/DAST Tool Administrator/API Key:** If using commercial or external open-source tools, you'll need administrative access or API keys to configure and integrate them with Azure DevOps.

By meticulously planning and implementing these steps, you can establish a robust security testing framework for your Dynamics 365 applications within your Azure DevOps environment. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and refinement of your SAST/DAST processes are essential.
